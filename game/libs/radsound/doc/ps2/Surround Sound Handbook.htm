<H3>What types of surround sound are available for the PS2?</H3>There are three 
types of surround sound:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Dolby Digital (digital output via SP/DIF connector) 
  <LI>DTS (digital output via SP/DIF connector) 
  <LI>Dolby ProLogic (via analogue output) </LI></UL>
<HR>

<H2>DTS Surround Sound</H2>
<H3>How can I perform DTS digital surround sound output?</H3>DTS have a PS2 SDK 
available, which will mix up to 6 channels of PCM sound into a DTS compatible 
stream in realtime, and send it out the SP/DIF optical out connector at the back 
of the PS2. For more information, contact:

<H2>Dolby Surround Sound</H2>
<H3>What types of Dolby Surround Sound are available for the PS2?</H3>There are 
two types of Dolby surround sound available for the PS2:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Dolby Digital (also known as AC3 and 5.1) 
  <LI>Dolby Prologic </LI></OL>
<H4><I>Dolby Digital</I></H4>
<OL>
  <LI>It is currently not possible to encode Dolby Digital in real time on the 
  PS2. Processing time would be high. Also, another side effect would be that 
  all of your SFX would need to be stored as RAW PCM data - rather than as 
  ADPCM. This, therefore would take a lot of RAM! 
  <LI>Playing Dolby Digital will mean that you can not play any other sound at 
  the same time. The PlayStation 2 will set a mode which will bypass all other 
  audio playback if you are playing a Dolby Digital bit stream. This makes sense 
  really, as the 5.1 bit stream is, say, like a MP3 file. You can't just start 
  adding more data to this file without having to go through the whole encoding 
  process. 
  <LI>I recommend using Dolby Digital for FMV and cut sequences. It does sound 
  very good, but is not suited for in-game purposes. 
  <LI>See the sample code <A 
  href="https://www.ps2-pro.com/projects/sm-spdif">SimpleSPDIF.ZIP</A> which is 
  available on the support web site for how to incorporate Dolby Digital 
  playback in your project. </LI></OL>
<H4><I>Dolby Pro-logic</I></H4>
<OL>
  <LI>Dolby Pro-logic can work in real time. 
  <LI>Dolby Pro-logic treats the back two speakers as mono. 
  <LI>Real time Dolby Pro-logic takes hardly any processing time. </LI></OL>
<H3>How is Dolby Pro-logic played back in real time?</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>You need to play the same sample on two different SPU channels, with the 
  same pitch/ADSR settings. 
  <LI>A small delay is required between keying on the first and second SPU 
  channel. Just by setting up the pitch/ADSR1/ADSR2/SPU Address is enough of a 
  delay, so it is not really a problem. 
  <LI>Then, you need to set the volumes of these two channels like this:
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPUChannel1_Volume = Front_Left, Front_Right (as 
  normal)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPUChannel2_Volume = Back_Volume, 
  -BackVolume (sets the volume for the rear speakers)
  <P>Note that because the top bit of the SPU2 Volume registers is used for 
  other purposes, such as automatic volume fade up/down etc. You need really to 
  do this:
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPUChannel2_Volume = Back_Volume, 0x7fff - 
  BackVolume
  <P>And that's it! </P></LI></OL>
<H3>Why can't I mix these two channel volumes together and only use one 
channel?</H3>You can't mix these two channel volumes together and then use only 
one SPU channel due to the fact that both channels will be actually playing 
slightly different sound data (due to the delay between the keying on for the 
second channel) 
<H3>Is it possible with only one channel?</H3>Yes, but you will have a few 
problems: 
<OL>
  <LI>You will hear the sound flip from back/left to back/right if the source of 
  the sound moves across the centre of the screen. 
  <LI>You can't play the SFX at full volume (using one channel involves a 
  channel volume "bleeding" through to the back speakers (ie. volume = 
  0x2000,-0x4000). 
  <LI>So its only really useful for single spot FX which are far away. Like 
  something that will ALWAYS only require one channel and that won't move around 
  the playing area too much, which would cause the sound to flip from the front 
  left/right speakers. Also, being far away, it would not require its volume 
  level to be high anyway. 
  <LI>Basically, I recommend using two channels if possible, so you never have 
  to deal with these problems anyway. </LI></OL></BODY></HTML>
