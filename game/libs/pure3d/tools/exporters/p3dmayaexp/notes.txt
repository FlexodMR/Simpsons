Build instructions for the Pure3D Maya exporter:

note: this has changed from detailed build instructions
to simply a list of stuff to check that might be different
on your local machine from the checked-in .dsp.

Also note that right now the settings in the project are only 
correct for the Debug build.

Basically, the main things to check for are the include directories 
for pure3d, and Maya.

My pure3d is in 
D:\pure3d\p3dv12\....

Maya is in:
C:\Aw\Maya2.5\....

Also note that I set the output file to be:
C:\Aw\Maya2.5\bin\plug-ins\p3dmayaexp.mll




//-----------------------------------------
left over from the original howtobuild.txt:

-----------------------
build settings in MSVC:
-----------------------

 - create a win32 dynamic-link-library project called p3dmayaexp
 - preprocessor defines must have: NT_PLUGIN
 - include path must have: ...maya2.5\include, ...toollib\inc
 - under code-generation, use run-time library: Multithreaded DLL
 - under link|project options, add:
      /export:initializePlugin /export:uninitializePlugin
 - under link|general, rename output file to .mll (instead of .dll)
   (I also like to change the output location to put it in the maya2.5\bin\plug-ins dir)
