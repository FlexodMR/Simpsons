# Simple viewer script to write out an avi and then exit
#
# Usage : 
#    p3dview -command "c_exec scripts/avi.cfg"
#
# You can either change the commands, add you own, or you might also want to 
# overide some settigns on the command line with additional commands after the 
# script is executed :
#
#    p3dview -command "c_exec scripts/avi.cfg" -command "camera myCamera"
#

# turn off all the overlays
s_set avi.cleanDisplay 1
