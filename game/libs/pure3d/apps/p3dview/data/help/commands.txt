Command line options :

    -ini <filename> : 
        Example :
            p3dview -ini mysettings.ini

        Load an (client-side) settings file after base settings have been read in. This option 
        may appear multiple times. Particularly useful for having  viewer work on multiple platforms. 

    -command <command string>
        
        Execute <command string> immediatly upon startup (after any files specified on the command line are loaded).
        Useful for automating certain tasks (see scripts/screenshot.cfg and scripts/avi.cfg for an example).

    -s <filename> 
        Take screenshot and exit. This option is depriciated, run a script with -command instead 
        (-s just runs  : -command "c_exec scripts/screenshot.cfg" -command "screenshotName <filename>)

    -server 
        Run PC viewer in server only mode (need seperate client pplication to control). Only useful 
        for debugging communication code.
