# BeginSelect --
#
# This procedure is typically invoked on button-1 presses. It begins
# the process of making a selection in the listbox. Its exact behavior
# depends on the selection mode currently in effect for the listbox;
# see the Motif documentation for details.
#
# Arguments:
# w - The listbox widget.
# el - The element for the selection operation (typically the
# one under the pointer). Must be in numerical form.
