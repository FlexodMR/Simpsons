# BeginExtend --
#
# This procedure is typically invoked on shift-button-1 presses. It
# begins the process of extending a selection in the listbox. Its
# exact behavior depends on the selection mode currently in effect
# for the listbox; see the Motif documentation for details.
#
# Arguments:
# w - The listbox widget.
# el - The element for the selection operation (typically the
# one under the pointer). Must be in numerical form.

 my $w = shift;
 my $el = shift;

  {

  }
