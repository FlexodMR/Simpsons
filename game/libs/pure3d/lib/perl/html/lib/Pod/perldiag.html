perldiag - various Perl diagnostics


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):


<P>

<PRE>    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (optional).
    (S) A severe warning (mandatory).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
</PRE>

<P>

Optional warnings are enabled by using the <STRONG>-w</STRONG> switch. Warnings may be captured by setting <CODE>$SIG{__WARN__}</CODE> to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead of
printing it. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlvar.html#">the perlvar manpage</A>. Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#eval">eval</A>.


<P>

Some of these messages are generic. Spots that vary are denoted with a %s,
just as in a printf format. Note that some messages start with a %s! The
symbols <CODE>"%(-?@</CODE> sort before the letters, while <CODE>[</CODE> and <CODE>\</CODE> sort after.


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__my_">"my" variable %s can't be in a package

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so
it doesn't make sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the
front. Use <CODE>local()</CODE> if you want to localize a package variable.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>"my" variable %s masks earlier declaration in same scope

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> lexical variable has been redeclared in the same scope, effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance. This is almost always a typographical error. Note that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope or until all closure referents to it are destroyed.



<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__no_">"no" not allowed in expression

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The ``no'' keyword is recognized and executed at
compile time, and returns no useful value. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlmod.html#">the perlmod manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__use_">"use" not allowed in expression

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The ``use'' keyword is recognized and executed at
compile time, and returns no useful value. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlmod.html#">the perlmod manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__">% may only be used in unpack

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You can't pack a string by supplying a checksum,
because the checksumming process loses information, and you can't go the
other way. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#unpack">unpack</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__s">%s (...) interpreted as function

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> You've run afoul of the rule that says that any
list operator followed by parentheses turns into a function, with all the
list operators arguments found inside the parentheses. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlop.html#Terms_and_List_Operators_Leftwa">Terms and List Operators (Leftward)</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s argument is not a HASH element

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The argument to <CODE>exists()</CODE> must be a
hash element, such as


<P>

<PRE>    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;[12]-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s argument is not a HASH element or slice

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The argument to <CODE>delete()</CODE> must be
either a hash element, such as


<P>

<PRE>    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;[12]-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}
</PRE>

<P>

or a hash slice, such as


<P>

<PRE>    @foo{$bar, $baz, $xyzzy}
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s did not return a true value

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly. It's traditional to end such a file with a ``1;'', though any true value would do. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#require">require</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s found where operator expected

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or
an operator. If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to
see an operator, it gives you this warning. Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s had compilation errors

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The final summary message when a <CODE>perl -c</CODE> fails.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s has too many errors

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The parser has given up trying to parse the
program after 10 errors. Further error messages would likely be
uninformative.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s matches null string many times

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> The pattern you've specified would be an infinite
loop if the regular expression engine didn't specifically check for that.
See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlre.html#">the perlre manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s never introduced

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> The symbol in question was declared but somehow
went out of scope before it could possibly have been used.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s syntax OK

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The final summary message when a <CODE>perl -c</CODE> succeeds.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__s_">%s: Command not found

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(A)</FONT> You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s: Expression syntax

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(A)</FONT> You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s: Undefined variable

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(A)</FONT> You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>%s: not found

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(A)</FONT> You've accidentally run your script through the
Bourne shell instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your
script into Perl yourself.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__Missing">(Missing semicolon on previous line?)

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> This is an educated guess made in conjunction with
the message ``%s found where operator expected''. Don't automatically put a
semicolon on the previous line just because you saw this message.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__P">-P not allowed for setuid/setgid script

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The script would have to be opened by the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> preprocessor by name, which provides a race condition that breaks security.



<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__T">-T and -B not implemented on filehandles

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Perl can't peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles
when it doesn't know about your kind of stdio. You'll have to use a
filename instead.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__p">-p destination: %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> An error occurred during the implicit output
invoked by the <A HREF="#item__p">-p</A>
command-line switch. (This output goes to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT</FONT> unless you've redirected it with
<CODE>select().)</CODE>


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Server_error"> Server error

</A></STRONG>
See Server error.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__">?+* follows nothing in regexp

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You started a regular expression with a
quantifier. Backslash it if you meant it literally. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlre.html#">the perlre manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__">@ outside of string

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You had a pack template that specified an absolute
position outside the string being unpacked. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#pack">pack</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_accept">accept() on closed fd

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> You tried to do an accept on a closed socket. Did
you forget to check the return value of your <CODE>socket()</CODE> call?
See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#accept">accept</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Allocation">Allocation too large: %lx

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(X)</FONT> You can't allocate more than 
<FONT SIZE=-1>64K</FONT> on an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MS-DOS</FONT> machine.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Allocation too large

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You can't allocate more than 2^31+``small amount''
bytes.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Applying">Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> The pattern match (//), substitution (s///), and
translation (tr///) operators work on scalar values. If you apply one of
them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to a scalar
value -- the length of an array, or the population info of a hash -- and
then work on that scalar value. This is probably not what you meant to do.
See
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#grep">grep</A> and <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#map">map</A> for alternatives.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Arg">Arg too short for msgsnd

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> <CODE>msgsnd()</CODE> requires a string at least
as long as <CODE>sizeof(long).</CODE>


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Ambiguous">Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)(S)</FONT> You said something that may not be interpreted
the way you thought. Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by
supplying a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Args">Args must match #! line

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The setuid emulator requires that the arguments
Perl was invoked with match the arguments specified on the #! line. Since
some systems impose a one-argument limit on the #! line, try combining
switches; for example, turn <CODE>-w -U</CODE> into <CODE>-wU</CODE>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Argument">Argument "%s" isn't numeric%s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> The indicated string was fed as an argument to an
operator that expected a numeric value instead. If you're fortunate the
message will identify which operator was so unfortunate.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Array">Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(D)</FONT> Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names
in some spots. This is now heavily deprecated.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_assertion">assertion botched: %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> The malloc package that comes with Perl had an
internal failure.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Assertion">Assertion failed: file "%s"

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> general assertion failed. The file in question must be examined.



<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Assignment">Assignment to both a list and a scalar

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd
and 3rd arguments must either both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise
Perl won't know which context to supply to the right side.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Attempt">Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%lx

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> All 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SV</FONT> objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that will be garbage collected on exit. An 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SV</FONT> was discovered to be outside any of those arenas.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Attempt to free nonexistent shared string

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> Perl maintains a reference counted internal table
of strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings. This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of a
string that can no longer be found in the table.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Attempt to free temp prematurely

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the <CODE>free_tmps()</CODE> routine. This indicates that something else is freeing the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SV</FONT> before the <CODE>free_tmps()</CODE> routine gets a chance, which means that the <CODE>free_tmps()</CODE> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free it.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> The reference counts got screwed up on symbol
aliases.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could indicate that <CODE>SvREFCNT_dec()</CODE> was called too many times, or that <CODE>SvREFCNT_inc()</CODE> was called too few times, or that the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SV</FONT> was mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been corrupted.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> You tried to pass a temporary value (like the
result of a function, or a computed expression) to the ``p''
<CODE>pack()</CODE> template. This means the result contains a pointer to a
location that could become invalid anytime, even before the end of the
current statement. Use literals or global values as arguments to the ``p''
<CODE>pack()</CODE> template to avoid this warning.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> You supplied a reference as the first argument to
<CODE>substr()</CODE> used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps
you forgot to dereference it first. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#substr">substr</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad">Bad arg length for %s, is %d, should be %d

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of <CODE>msgctl(),</CODE> <CODE>semctl()</CODE> or <CODE>shmctl().</CODE> In 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,

sizeof(struct&nbsp;msqid_ds&nbsp;*), sizeof(struct&nbsp;semid_ds&nbsp;*), and
sizeof(struct&nbsp;shmid_ds&nbsp;*).


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Bad filehandle: %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol has no filehandle associated with it. Perhaps you didn't do an <CODE>open(),</CODE> or did it in another package.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Bad free() ignored

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> An internal routine called <CODE>free()</CODE> on
something that had never been <CODE>malloc()ed</CODE> in the first place.
Mandatory, but can be disabled by setting environment variable <CODE>PERL_BADFREE</CODE> to 1.


<P>

This message can be quite often seen with DB_File on systems with ``hard''
dynamic linking, like <CODE>AIX</CODE> and <CODE>OS/2</CODE>. It is a bug of
<CODE>Berkeley DB</CODE> which is left unnoticed if <CODE>DB</CODE> uses <EM>forgiving</EM>
system <CODE>malloc().</CODE>


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Bad hash

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> One of the internal hash routines was passed a null 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HV</FONT> pointer.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Bad name after %s::

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You started to name a symbol by using a package
prefix, and then didn't finish the symbol. In particular, you can't
interpolate outside of quotes, so


<P>

<PRE>    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = mypack::$var;
</PRE>

<P>

is not the same as


<P>

<PRE>    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Bad symbol for array

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> An internal request asked to add an array entry to
something that wasn't a symbol table entry.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Bad symbol for filehandle

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> An internal request asked to add a filehandle
entry to something that wasn't a symbol table entry.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Bad symbol for hash

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> An internal request asked to add a hash entry to
something that wasn't a symbol table entry.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Badly">Badly placed ()'s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(A)</FONT> You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bareword">Bareword "%s" not allowed while "strict subs" in use

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> With ``strict subs'' in use, a bareword is only
allowed as a subroutine identifier, in curly braces or to the left of the
``=&gt;'' symbol. Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_BEGIN">BEGIN failed--compilation aborted

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> An untrapped exception was raised while executing a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BEGIN</FONT> subroutine. Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is exited.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Perl found a <A HREF="#item_BEGIN_">BEGIN {}</A> subroutine (or a <A HREF="#item_use">use</A> directive, which implies a <A HREF="#item_BEGIN_">BEGIN {}</A>) after one or more compilation errors had already occurred. Since the
intended environment for the <A HREF="#item_BEGIN_">BEGIN {}</A>
could not be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code
likely depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_bind">bind() on closed fd

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> You tried to do a bind on a closed socket. Did you
forget to check the return value of your <CODE>socket()</CODE> call? See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#bind">bind</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bizarre">Bizarre copy of %s in %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value
that is not copiable.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Callback">Callback called exit

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> subroutine invoked from an external package via <CODE>perl_call_sv()</CODE> exited by calling exit.



<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Can">Can't "goto" outside a block

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> ``goto'' statement was executed to jump out of what might look like a block, except that it isn't a proper block. This usually occurs if you tried to jump out of a <CODE>sort()</CODE> block or subroutine, which is a no-no. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#goto">goto</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't "goto" into the middle of a foreach loop

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> ``goto'' statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach loop. You can't get there from here. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#goto">goto</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't "last" outside a block

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> ``last'' statement was executed to break out of the current block, except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current block. Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't count as a ``loopish'' block, as doesn't a block given to <CODE>sort().</CODE> You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#last">last</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't "next" outside a block

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> ``next'' statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but there isn't a current block. Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't count as a ``loopish'' block, as doesn't a block given to <CODE>sort().</CODE> You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#next">next</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't "redo" outside a block

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> ``redo'' statement was executed to restart the current block, but there isn't a current block. Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't count as a ``loopish'' block, as doesn't a block given to <CODE>sort().</CODE> You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#redo">redo</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't bless non-reference value

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Only hard references may be blessed. This is how
Perl ``enforces'' encapsulation of objects. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlobj.html#">the perlobj manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't break at that line

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> warning intended to only be printed while running within the debugger, indicating the line number specified wasn't the location of a statement that could be stopped at.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't call method "%s" in empty package "%s"

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package functioning as a class, but that package doesn't have 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ANYTHING</FONT> defined in it, let alone methods. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlobj.html#">the perlobj manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't call method "%s" on unblessed reference

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> method call must know in what package it's supposed to run. It ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you didn't supply an object reference in this case. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> reference isn't an object reference until it has been blessed. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlobj.html#">the perlobj manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't call method "%s" without a package or object reference

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot
filled by the object reference or package name contains an expression that
returns neither an object reference nor a package name. (Perhaps it's
null?) Something like this will reproduce the error:


<P>

<PRE>    $BADREF = undef;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't chdir to %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You called <CODE>perl -x/foo/bar</CODE>, but <CODE>/foo/bar</CODE> is not a directory that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesn't
exist.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't coerce %s to integer in %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol
table entries (typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are. So
you can't say things like:


<P>

<PRE>    *foo += 1;
</PRE>

<P>

You 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CAN</FONT> say


<P>

<PRE>    $foo = *foo;
    $foo += 1;
</PRE>

<P>

but then <CODE>$foo</CODE> no longer contains a glob.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't coerce %s to number in %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be

<DT><STRONG>Can't do inplace edit on %s: %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> The creation of the new file failed for the

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't do inplace edit without backup

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You're on a system such as 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MS-DOS</FONT> that gets confused if you try reading from a deleted (but still opened) file. You have to say
 <CODE>-i.bak</CODE>, or some such.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't do inplace edit: %s gt 14 characters

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> The setuid emulator of suidperl failed for some
reason.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't do setuid

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> This typically means that ordinary perl tried to
exec suidperl to do setuid emulation, but couldn't exec it. It looks for a
name of the form sperl5.000 in the same directory that the perl executable
resides under the name perl5.000, typically /usr/local/bin on Unix
machines. If the file is there, check the execute permissions. If it isn't,
ask your sysadmin why he and/or she removed it.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't do waitpid with flags

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> This machine doesn't have either
<CODE>waitpid()</CODE> or <CODE>wait4(),</CODE> so only
<CODE>waitpid()</CODE> without flags is emulated.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't do {n,m} with n gt m

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Minima must be less than or equal to maxima. If

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't emulate -%s on #! line

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make
sense at this point. For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a <STRONG>-x</STRONG> on the #! line.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't exec "%s": %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> An <CODE>system(),</CODE> <CODE>exec(),</CODE> or
piped open call could not execute the named program for the indicated
reason. Typical reasons include: the permissions were wrong on the file,
the file wasn't found in <CODE>$ENV{PATH}</CODE>, the executable in question was compiled for another architecture, or the
#! line in a script points to an interpreter that can't be run for similar
reasons. (Or maybe your system doesn't support #! at all.)


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't exec %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Perl was trying to execute the indicated program
for you because that's what the #! line said. If that's not what you
wanted, you may need to mention ``perl'' on the #! line somewhere.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't execute %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You used the <STRONG>-S</STRONG> switch, but the copies of the script to execute found in the

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You used the <STRONG>-S</STRONG> switch, but the script to execute could not be found in the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PATH,</FONT> or at least not with the correct permissions. The script exists in the current directory, but 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PATH</FONT> prohibits running it.

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't find label %s

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines. This

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a pipeline.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> warning peculiar to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS.</FONT> This arises because of the difference between access checks under 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS</FONT> and under the Unix model Perl assumes. Under 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS,</FONT> access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account. Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the access checking routine. It will try to retrieve the filespec using the device name and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FID</FONT> present in the stat buffer, but this works only if you haven't made a subsequent call to the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CRTL</FONT> <CODE>stat()</CODE> routine, because the device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up and returned 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FALSE,</FONT> just to be conservative. (Note: The access checking routine knows about the Perl
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_stat">stat</A> operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever see this warning in response
to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal code takes stat buffers
lightly.)


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't get pipe mailbox device name

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> An error peculiar to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS.</FONT> After creating a mailbox to act as a pipe, Perl can't retrieve its name for later use.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> An error peculiar to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS.</FONT> Perl asked <CODE>$GETSYI</CODE> how big you want your mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an answer.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The deeply magical ``goto subroutine'' call can only replace one subroutine call for another. It can't manufacture one out of whole cloth. In general you should be calling it out of only an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>AUTOLOAD</FONT> routine anyway. See

<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#goto">goto</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't localize through a reference

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You said something like <CODE>local $$ref</CODE>, which Perl can't currently handle, because when it goes to restore the
old value of whatever <A
HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item__ref">$ref</A> pointed to
after the scope of the <CODE>local()</CODE> is finished, it can't be sure
that <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item__ref">$ref</A>
will still be a reference.  


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't localize lexical variable %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You used local on a variable name that was
previously declared as a lexical variable using ``my''. This is not
allowed. If you want to localize a package variable of the same name,
qualify it with the package name.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> function (or method) was called in a package which allows autoload, but there is no function to autoload. Most probable causes are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to
 <CODE>AutoSplit</CODE> the file, say, by doing <CODE>make install</CODE>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't locate %s in @INC

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You said to do (or require, or use) a file that couldn't be found in any of the libraries mentioned in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>@INC.</FONT> Perhaps you need to set the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PERL5LIB</FONT> or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PERL5OPT</FONT> environment variable to say where the extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>@INC.</FONT> Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#require">require</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s"

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You called a method correctly, and it correctly
indicated a package functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define
that particular method, nor does any of its base classes. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlobj.html#">the perlobj manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA

<DT><STRONG>Can't make list assignment to \%ENV on this system

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> List assignment to <CODE>%ENV</CODE> is not supported on some systems, notably 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS.</FONT>



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't mktemp()

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The <CODE>mktemp()</CODE> routine failed for some
reason while trying to process a <STRONG>-e</STRONG> switch. Maybe your /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't modify %s in %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You aren't allowed to assign to the item

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't open %s: %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> The implicit opening of a file through use of the <CODE>&lt;&gt;</CODE>
filehandle, either implicitly under the <A HREF="#item__n">-n</A> or <A HREF="#item__p">-p</A> command-line switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.
Usually this is because you don't have read permission for a file which you
named on the command line.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't open bidirectional pipe

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> You tried to say <A HREF="#item_open">open(CMD, "|cmd|")</A>, which is not supported. You can try any of several modules in the Perl
library to do this, such as IPC::Open2. Alternately, direct the pipe's
output to a file using ``&gt;'', and then read it in under a different file handle.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't open error file %s as stderr

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> An error peculiar to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS.</FONT> Perl does its own command line redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '2
&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on the command line for writing.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't open input file %s as stdin

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> An error peculiar to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS.</FONT> Perl does its own command line redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '
&lt;' on the command line for reading.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't open output file %s as stdout

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> An error peculiar to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS.</FONT> Perl does its own command line redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't open output pipe (name: %s)

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> An error peculiar to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS.</FONT> Perl does its own command line redirection, and couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined for stdout.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't open perl script "%s": %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The script you specified can't be opened for the
indicated reason.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't redefine active sort subroutine %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Perl optimizes the internal handling of sort
subroutines and keeps pointers into them. You tried to redefine one such
sort subroutine when it was currently active, which is not allowed. If you
really want to do this, you should write <CODE>sort { &func } @x</CODE> instead of <CODE>sort func @x</CODE>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> The rename done by the <STRONG>-i</STRONG> switch failed for some reason, probably because you don't have write
permission to the directory.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> An error peculiar to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS.</FONT> Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried to reopen it to accept binary data. Alas, it failed.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't reswap uid and euid

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> The <CODE>setreuid()</CODE> call failed for some
reason in the setuid emulator of suidperl.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't return outside a subroutine

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The return statement was executed in mainline
code, that is, where there was no subroutine call to return out of. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlsub.html#">the perlsub manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't stat script "%s"

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> For some reason you can't <CODE>fstat()</CODE> the
script even though you have it open already. Bizarre.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't swap uid and euid

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> The <CODE>setreuid()</CODE> call failed for some
reason in the setuid emulator of suidperl.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't take log of %g

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Logarithms are defined on only positive real
numbers.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't take sqrt of %g

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the
square root of a negative number. There's a Complex package available for
Perl, though, if you really want to do that.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't undef active subroutine

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You can't undefine a routine that's currently
running. You can, however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even
undef the redefined subroutine while the old routine is running. Go figure.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't unshift

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You tried to unshift an ``unreal'' array that
can't be unshifted, such as the main Perl stack.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't upgrade that kind of scalar

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> The internal sv_upgrade routine adds ``members'' to an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SV,</FONT> making it into a more specialized kind of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SV.</FONT> The top several 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SV</FONT> types are so specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted. This message indicates that such a conversion was attempted.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't upgrade to undef

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(P)</FONT> The undefined 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SV</FONT> is the bottom of the totem pole, in the scheme of upgradability. Upgrading to undef indicates an error in the code calling sv_upgrade.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't use "my %s" in sort comparison

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The global variables <A HREF="#item__a">$a</A> and
<A HREF="#item__b">$b</A> are reserved for sort comparisons. You mentioned
<A HREF="#item__a">$a</A> or <A HREF="#item__b">$b</A> in the same line as
the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator, and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical
variable. Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename
the lexical variable.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't use %s for loop variable

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a
loop variable on a foreach.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't use %s ref as %s ref

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You've mixed up your reference types. You have to
dereference a reference of the type needed. You can use the
<CODE>ref()</CODE> function to test the type of the reference, if need be.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't use \1 to mean $1 in expression

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary
operator that creates a reference to its argument. The use of backslash to
indicate a backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a
regular expression pattern. Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code
produces a value that prints out looking like <CODE>SCALAR(0xdecaf).</CODE>
Use the <CODE>$1</CODE> form instead.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't use bareword ("%s") as %s ref while \"strict refs\" in use

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Only hard references are allowed by ``strict
refs''. Symbolic references are disallowed. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlref.html#">the perlref manpage</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't use string ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't use an undefined value as %s reference

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must be a defined value. This helps to delurk some insidious errors.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't use global %s in "my"

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You tried to declare a magical variable as a
lexical variable. This is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to
only one location (namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly
confusing to have variables in your program that looked like magical
variables but weren't.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't use subscript on %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed
expression as a subscript. But to the left of the brackets was an
expression that didn't look like an array reference, or anything else
subscriptable.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't write to temp file for -e: %s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The write routine failed for some reason while
trying to process a <STRONG>-e</STRONG> switch. Maybe your /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Can't x= to read-only value

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> You tried to repeat a constant value (often the
undefined value) with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the
value itself. Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat
that.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Cannot">Cannot open temporary file

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The create routine failed for some reason while
trying to process a <STRONG>-e</STRONG> switch. Maybe your /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Cannot resolve method `%s' overloading `%s' in package `%s'

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F|P)</FONT> Error resolving overloading specified by a

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Compilation">Compilation failed in require

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Perl could not compile a file specified in a <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_require">require</A> statement. Perl uses this generic message when none of the errors that it

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Deep">Deep recursion on subroutine "%s"

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> This subroutine has called itself (directly or

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> In a here document construct like <CODE>&lt;&lt;FOO</CODE>, the label

<DT><STRONG>Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> You probably said %hash{$key} when you meant

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(S)</FONT> This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message ``%s found where operator expected''. It often means a subroutine or module name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet. This may be because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing ``sub'', ``package'', ``require'', or ``use'' statement. If you're referencing something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have to define the subroutine or package before the current location. You can use an empty ``sub foo;'' or ``package

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Perl limits identifiers (names for variables,

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> carriage return character was found in the input. This is an error, and not a warning, because carriage return characters can break multi-line strings, including here documents (e.g.,
 <CODE>print &lt;&lt;EOF;</CODE>).


<P>

Under Unix, this error is usually caused by executing Perl code -- either
the main program, a module, or an eval'd string -- that was transferred
over a network connection from a non-Unix system without properly
converting the text file format.


<P>

Under systems that use something other than '\n' to delimit lines of text,
this error can also be caused by reading Perl code from a file handle that
is in binary mode (as set by the <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_binmode">binmode</A> operator).


<P>

In either case, the Perl code in question will probably need to be
converted with something like <CODE>s/\x0D\x0A?/\n/g</CODE> before it can be executed.

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_In">In string, @%s now must be written as \@%s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> It used to be that Perl would try to guess whether
you wanted an array interpolated or a literal @. It did this when the
string was first used at runtime. Now strings are parsed at compile time,
and ambiguous instances of @ must be disambiguated, either by prepending a
backslash to indicate a literal, or by declaring (or using) the array
within the program before the string (lexically). (Someday it will simply
assume that an unbackslashed @ interpolates an array.)

<P>

One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported a
constant to your name space with <STRONG>use</STRONG> or <STRONG>import</STRONG> while no such importing took place, it may for example be that your
operating system does not support that particular constant. Hopefully you
did use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see, please
see
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#use">use</A> and <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#import">import</A>. While an explicit import list would probably have caught this error
earlier it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating system
still does not support that constant. Maybe you have a typo in the
constants of the symbol import list of <STRONG>use</STRONG> or <STRONG>import</STRONG> or in the constant name at the line where this error was triggered?

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> The current implementation of regular expressions
uses shorts as address offsets within a string. Unfortunately this means

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to
select a single element of an array. Generally it's better to ask for a
scalar value (indicated by $). The difference is that <CODE>$foo[&bar]</CODE> always behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating
its argument, while <CODE>@foo[&bar]</CODE> behaves like a list when you assign to it, and provides a list context to
its subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one
subscript.


<P>

On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array element
as a list, you need to look into how references work, because Perl will not
magically convert between scalars and lists for you. See

    A comma is missing.
    An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.
    An opening or closing brace is missing.

<P>

Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax error
giving more information. (Sometimes it helps to turn on <STRONG>-w</STRONG>.) The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up. Sometimes the actual error is several tokens before
this, because Perl is good at understanding random input. Occasionally the
line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon the only way to
figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<CODE>perl -c</CODE> repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see if the error
went away. Sort of the cybernetic version of 20&nbsp;questions.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>syntax error at line %d: `%s' unexpected

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> Configure couldn't find the <CODE>crypt()</CODE> function on your machine, probably because your vendor didn't supply it, probably because they think the

<DT><STRONG>Too late for "-T" option

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(X)</FONT> The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script
contains the
<STRONG>-T</STRONG> option, but Perl was not invoked with <STRONG>-T</STRONG> in its command line. This is an error because, by the time Perl discovers a <STRONG>-T</STRONG> in a script, it's too late to properly taint everything from the
environment. So Perl gives up.


<P>

If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #! mechanism
(or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by editing the
#! line so that the <STRONG>-T</STRONG> option is a part of Perl's first argument: e.g. change <CODE>perl -n -T</CODE> to <CODE>perl -T -n</CODE>.


<P>

If the Perl script is being executed as <CODE>perl scriptname</CODE>, then the
<STRONG>-T</STRONG> option must appear on the command line: <CODE>perl -T scriptname</CODE>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Too late for "-%s" option

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(X)</FONT> The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script
contains the

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Use">Use of "$$<digit>" to mean "${$}<digit>" is deprecated

<FONT SIZE=-1>(D)</FONT> Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type

taken to mean ``${$}0'' instead of ``${$0}''. This bug is (mostly) fixed in
Perl 5.004.


<P>

However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely,
because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
``$$0'' in a string. So Perl 5.004 still interprets ``$$&lt;digit&gt;'' in
the old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this message as a
warning. And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment will cease.

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(D)</FONT> It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(D)</FONT> As an (ahem) accidental feature, <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> subroutines are looked up as methods (using the <CODE>@ISA</CODE> hierarchy) even when the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain
functions (e.g. <CODE>Foo::bar()</CODE>), not as methods (e.g. <CODE>Foo-</CODE><CODE>bar()></CODE> or <CODE>$obj-</CODE><CODE>bar()>).</CODE>


<P>

This bug will be rectified in Perl 5.005, which will use method lookup only
for methods' <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE>s. However, there is a significant base of existing code that may be using
the old behavior. So, as an interim step, Perl 5.004 issues an optional
warning when non-methods use inherited <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE>s.


<P>

The simple rule is: Inheritance will not work when autoloading non-methods.
The simple fix for old code is: In any module that used to depend on
inheriting <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> for non-methods from a base class named
<CODE>BaseClass</CODE>, execute <CODE>*AUTOLOAD = \&BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</CODE> during startup.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Use of %s is deprecated

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(D)</FONT> The construct indicated is no longer recommended

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Use of uninitialized value

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> An undefined value was used as if it were already

To suppress this warning assign an initial value to your variables.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Useless">Useless use of %s in void context

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> You did something without a side effect in a context that does nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator. Very often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parse your program the way you thought it would. For example, you'd get this if you mixed up your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> precedence with Python precedence and said



<P>

<PRE>    $one, $two = 1, 2;
</PRE>

<P>

when you meant to say


<P>

<PRE>    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);
</PRE>

<P>

Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for example,
if you say


<P>

<PRE>    $array = (1,2);
</PRE>

<P>

when you should have said


<P>

<PRE>    $array = [1,2];
</PRE>

<P>

The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value, while
parentheses do not. So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in a scalar
context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which throws away
the left argument, which is not what you want. See
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlref.html#">the perlref manpage</A> for more on this.

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Variable">Variable "%s" is not imported%s

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(F)</FONT> While ``use strict'' in effect, you referred to a
global variable that you apparently thought was imported from another
module, because something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is
exported by that module. It usually means you put the wrong funny character
on the front of your variable.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Variable "%s" may be unavailable

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> An inner (nested) <EM>anonymous</EM> subroutine is inside a <EM>named</EM>
subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the anonymous
(innermost) subroutine is referencing a lexical variable defined in the
outermost subroutine. For example:


<P>

<PRE>   sub outermost { my $a; sub middle { sub { $a } } }
</PRE>

<P>

If the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced (directly or
indirectly) from the outermost subroutine, it will share the variable as
you would expect. But if the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced
when the outermost subroutine is not active, it will see the value of the
shared variable as it was before and during the *first* call to the
outermost subroutine, which is probably not what you want.


<P>

In these circumstances, it is usually best to make the middle subroutine
anonymous, using the <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sub_">sub {}</A> syntax. Perl has specific support for shared variables in nested anonymous
subroutines; a named subroutine in between interferes with this feature.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Variable "%s" will not stay shared

</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(W)</FONT> An inner (nested) <EM>named</EM> subroutine is referencing a lexical variable defined in an outer
subroutine.


<P>

When the inner subroutine is called, it will probably see the value of the
outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first* call to
the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the outer
subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer
share a common value for the variable. In other words, the variable will no
longer be shared.


<P>

Furthermore, if the outer subroutine is anonymous and references a lexical
variable outside itself, then the outer and inner subroutines will <EM>never</EM> share the given variable.


<P>

This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sub_">sub {}</A> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference variables in outer
subroutines are called or referenced, they are automatically rebound to the
current values of such variables.
