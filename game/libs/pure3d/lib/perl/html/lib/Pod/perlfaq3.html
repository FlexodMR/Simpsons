This section of the

Have you looked at 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> (see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfaq2.html#">the perlfaq2 manpage</A>)? The chances are that someone has already written a module that can solve
your problem. Have you read the appropriate man pages? Here's a brief
index:

</PRE>

<P>

<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perltoc.html#">the perltoc manpage</A> provides a crude table of contents for the perl man page set.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_use_Perl_interactively">How can I use Perl interactively?

</A></H2>
The typical approach uses the Perl debugger, described in the
<CODE>perldebug(1)</CODE> man page, on an ``empty'' program, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    perl -de 42
</PRE>

<P>

Now just type in any legal Perl code, and it will be immediately evaluated.
You can also examine the symbol table, get stack backtraces, check variable
values, set breakpoints, and other operations typically found in symbolic
debuggers


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Is_there_a_Perl_shell_">Is there a Perl shell?

</A></H2>
In general, no. The Shell.pm module (distributed with perl) makes perl try
commands which aren't part of the Perl language as shell commands. perlsh
from the source distribution is simplistic and uninteresting, but may still
be what you want.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_debug_my_Perl_programs_">How do I debug my Perl programs?

</A></H2>
Have you used <A HREF="#item__w">-w</A>?


<P>

Have you tried <CODE>use strict</CODE>?


<P>

Did you check the returns of each and every system call?


<P>

Did you read <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perltrap.html#">the perltrap manpage</A>?


<P>

Have you tried the Perl debugger, described in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perldebug.html#">the perldebug manpage</A>?


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_profile_my_Perl_program">How do I profile my Perl programs?

</A></H2>
You should get the Devel::DProf module from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN,</FONT> and also use Benchmark.pm from the standard
distribution. Benchmark lets you time specific portions of your code, while
Devel::DProf gives detailed breakdowns of where your code spends its time.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_cross_reference_my_Perl">How do I cross-reference my Perl programs?

</A></H2>
The B::Xref module, shipped with the new, alpha-release Perl compiler (not
the general distribution), can be used to generate cross-reference reports
for Perl programs.


<P>

<PRE>    perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] foo.pl
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Is_there_a_pretty_printer_forma">Is there a pretty-printer (formatter) for Perl?

</A></H2>
There is no program that will reformat Perl as much as <CODE>indent(1)</CODE> will do for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C.</FONT> The complex feedback between the scanner and the parser (this feedback is what confuses the vgrind and emacs programs) makes it challenging at best to write a stand-alone Perl parser.



<P>

Of course, if you simply follow the guidelines in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlstyle.html#">the perlstyle manpage</A>, you shouldn't need to reformat.


<P>

Your editor can and should help you with source formatting. The perl-mode
for emacs can provide a remarkable amount of help with most (but not all)
code, and even less programmable editors can provide significant
assistance.


<P>

If you are using to using vgrind program for printing out nice code to a
laser printer, you can take a stab at this using <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/misc/tips/working.vgrind.entry,">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/misc/tips/working.vgrind.entry,</A>
but the results are not particularly satisfying for sophisticated code.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Is_there_a_ctags_for_Perl_">Is there a ctags for Perl?

</A></H2>
There's a simple one at <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/ptags.gz">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/ptags.gz</A>
which may do the trick.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Where_can_I_get_Perl_macros_for_">Where can I get Perl macros for vi?

</A></H2>
For a complete version of Tom Christiansen's vi configuration file, see <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.perl.com/pub/vi/toms.exrc,">ftp://ftp.perl.com/pub/vi/toms.exrc,</A>
the standard benchmark file for vi emulators. This runs best with nvi, the
current version of vi out of Berkeley, which incidentally can be built with
an embedded Perl interpreter -- see <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/misc">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/misc</A>
.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Where_can_I_get_perl_mode_for_em">Where can I get perl-mode for emacs?

</A></H2>
Since Emacs version 19 patchlevel 22 or so, there have been both a
perl-mode.el and support for the perl debugger built in. These should come
with the standard Emacs 19 distribution.


<P>

In the perl source directory, you'll find a directory called ``emacs'',
which contains a cperl-mode that color-codes keywords, provides
context-sensitive help, and other nifty things.


<P>

Note that the perl-mode of emacs will have fits with ``main'foo'' (single
quote), and mess up the indentation and hilighting. You should be using
``main::foo'', anyway.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_use_curses_with_Perl_">How can I use curses with Perl?

</A></H2>
The Curses module from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> provides a dynamically loadable object module
interface to a curses library.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_use_X_or_Tk_with_Perl_">How can I use X or Tk with Perl?

</A></H2>
Tk is a completely Perl-based, object-oriented interface to the Tk toolkit that doesn't force you to use Tcl just to get at Tk. Sx is an interface to the Athena Widget set. Both are available from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN.</FONT>



<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_generate_simple_menus_">How can I generate simple menus without using CGI or Tk?

</A></H2>
The <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/SKUNZ/perlmenu.v4.0.tar.gz">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/SKUNZ/perlmenu.v4.0.tar.gz</A>
module, which is curses-based, can help with this.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Can_I_dynamically_load_C_routine">Can I dynamically load C routines into Perl?

</A></H2>
If your system architecture supports it, then the standard perl on your
system should also provide you with this via the DynaLoader module. Read <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlxstut.html#">the perlxstut manpage</A> for details.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_is_undump_">What is undump?

</A></H2>
See the next questions.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_make_my_Perl_program_r">How can I make my Perl program run faster?

</A></H2>
The best way to do this is to come up with a better algorithm. This can
often make a dramatic difference. Chapter 8 in the Camel has some
efficiency tips in it you might want to look at.


<P>

Other approaches include autoloading seldom-used Perl code. See the AutoSplit and AutoLoader modules in the standard distribution for that. Or you could locate the bottleneck and think about writing just that part in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C,</FONT> the way we used to take bottlenecks in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> code and write them in assembler. Similar to rewriting in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> is the use of modules that have critical sections written in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> (for instance, the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PDL</FONT> module from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN).</FONT>



<P>

In some cases, it may be worth it to use the backend compiler to produce byte code (saving compilation time) or compile into 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C,</FONT> which will certainly save compilation time and sometimes a small amount (but not much) execution time. See the question about compiling your Perl programs.



<P>

If you're currently linking your perl executable to a shared libc.so, you
can often gain a 10-25% performance benefit by rebuilding it to link with a
static libc.a instead. This will make a bigger perl executable, but your
Perl programs (and programmers) may thank you for it. See the <EM>INSTALL</EM> file in the source distribution for more information.


<P>

Unsubstantiated reports allege that Perl interpreters that use sfio outperform those that don't (for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>IO</FONT> intensive applications). To try this, see the
 <EM>INSTALL</EM> file in the source distribution, especially the ``Selecting File 
<FONT SIZE=-1>IO</FONT> mechanisms'' section.


<P>

The undump program was an old attempt to speed up your Perl program by
storing the already-compiled form to disk. This is no longer a viable
option, as it only worked on a few architectures, and wasn't a good
solution anyway.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_make_my_Perl_program_t">How can I make my Perl program take less memory?

</A></H2>
When it comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly always prefers to throw memory at a problem. Scalars in Perl use more memory than strings in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C,</FONT> arrays take more that, and hashes use even more. While there's still a lot to be done, recent releases have been addressing these issues. For example, as of 5.004, duplicate hash keys are shared amongst all hashes using them, so require no reallocation.



<P>

In some cases, using <CODE>substr()</CODE> or <CODE>vec()</CODE> to simulate arrays can be highly beneficial. For example, an array of a thousand booleans will take at least 20,000 bytes of space, but it can be turned into one 125-byte bit vector for a considerable memory savings. The standard Tie::SubstrHash module can also help for certain types of data structure. If you're working with specialist data structures (matrices, for instance) modules that implement these in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> may use less memory than equivalent Perl modules.



<P>

Another thing to try is learning whether your Perl was compiled with the
system malloc or with Perl's builtin malloc. Whichever one it is, try using
the other one and see whether this makes a difference. Information about
malloc is in the <EM>INSTALL</EM> file in the source distribution. You can find out whether you are using
perl's malloc by typing <CODE>perl -V:usemymalloc</CODE>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Is_it_unsafe_to_return_a_pointer">Is it unsafe to return a pointer to local data?

</A></H2>
No, Perl's garbage collection system takes care of this.


<P>

<PRE>    sub makeone {
        my @a = ( 1 .. 10 );
        return \@a;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    for $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        push @many, makeone();
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    print $many[4][5], &quot;\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    print &quot;@many\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_free_an_array_or_hash_">How can I free an array or hash so my program shrinks?

</A></H2>
You can't. Memory the system allocates to a program will never be returned
to the system. That's why long-running programs sometimes re-exec
themselves.


<P>

However, judicious use of <CODE>my()</CODE> on your variables will help make sure that they go out of scope so that Perl can free up their storage for use in other parts of your program. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(NB:</FONT> <CODE>my()</CODE> variables also execute about 10% faster than globals.) 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> global variable, of course, never goes out of scope, so you can't get its space automatically reclaimed, although <CODE>undef()ing</CODE> and/or <CODE>delete()ing</CODE> it will achieve the same effect. In general, memory allocation and de-allocation isn't something you can or should be worrying about much in Perl, but even this capability (preallocation of data types) is in the works.



<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_make_my_CGI_script_mor">How can I make my CGI script more efficient?

</A></H2>
Beyond the normal measures described to make general Perl programs faster or smaller, a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> program has additional issues. It may be run several times per second. Given that each time it runs it will need to be re-compiled and will often allocate a megabyte or more of system memory, this can be a killer. Compiling into 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT>
 <STRONG>isn't going to help
you</STRONG> because the process start-up overhead is where the bottleneck is.


<P>

There are at least two popular ways to avoid this overhead. One solution involves running the Apache 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> server (available from <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/)">http://www.apache.org/)</A> with either of the mod_perl or mod_fastcgi plugin modules. With mod_perl and the Apache::* modules (from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN),</FONT> httpd will run with an embedded Perl interpreter which pre-compiles your script and then executes it within the same address space without forking. The Apache extension also gives Perl access to the internal server 
<FONT SIZE=-1>API,</FONT> so modules written in Perl can do just about anything a module written in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> can. With the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FCGI</FONT> module (from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN),</FONT> a Perl executable compiled with sfio (see the
 <EM>INSTALL</EM> file in the distribution) and the mod_fastcgi module (available from <A HREF="http://www.fastcgi.com/)">http://www.fastcgi.com/)</A> each of your perl scripts becomes a permanent 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> daemon processes.



<P>

Both of these solutions can have far-reaching effects on your system and on the way you write your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> scripts, so investigate them with care.



<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_hide_the_source_for_my">How can I hide the source for my Perl program?

</A></H2>
Delete it. :-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly unsatisfactory)
solutions with varying levels of ``security''.


<P>

First of all, however, you <EM>can't</EM> take away read permission, because the source code has to be readable in order to be compiled and interpreted. (That doesn't mean that a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> script's source is readable by people on the web, though.) So you have to leave the permissions at the socially friendly 0755 level.



<P>

Some people regard this as a security problem. If your program does
insecure things, and relies on people not knowing how to exploit those
insecurities, it is not secure. It is often possible for someone to
determine the insecure things and exploit them without viewing the source.
Security through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs instead of fixing
them, is little security indeed.


<P>

You can try using encryption via source filters (Filter::* from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN).</FONT> But crackers might be able to decrypt it. You
can try using the byte code compiler and interpreter described below, but
crackers might be able to de-compile it. You can try using the native-code
compiler described below, but crackers might be able to disassemble it.
These pose varying degrees of difficulty to people wanting to get at your
code, but none can definitively conceal it (this is true of every language,
not just Perl).


<P>

If you're concerned about people profiting from your code, then the bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive licence will give you legal security. License your software and pepper it with threatening statements like ``This is unpublished proprietary software of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XYZ</FONT> Corp. Your access to it does not give you permission to use it blah blah blah.'' We are not lawyers, of course, so you should see a lawyer if you want to be sure your licence's wording will stand up in court.

<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_compile_my_Perl_progra">How can I compile my Perl program into byte code or C?

</A></H2>
Malcolm Beattie has written a multifunction backend compiler, available from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN,</FONT> that can do both these things. It is as of Feb-1997 in late alpha release, which means it's fun to play with if you're a programmer but not really for people looking for turn-key solutions.



<P>

<EM>Please</EM> understand that merely compiling into 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> does not in and of itself guarantee that your code will run very much faster. That's because except for lucky cases where a lot of native type inferencing is possible, the normal Perl run time system is still present and thus will still take just as long to run and be just as big. Most programs save little more than compilation time, leaving execution no more than 10-30% faster. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> few rare programs actually benefit significantly (like several times faster), but this takes some tweaking of your code.



<P>

Malcolm will be in charge of the 5.005 release of Perl itself to try to
unify and merge his compiler and multithreading work into the main release.


<P>

You'll probably be astonished to learn that the current version of the
compiler generates a compiled form of your script whose executable is just
as big as the original perl executable, and then some. That's because as
currently written, all programs are prepared for a full <CODE>eval()</CODE>
statement. You can tremendously reduce this cost by building a shared
libperl.so library and linking against that. See the
<EM>INSTALL</EM> podfile in the perl source distribution for details. If you link your main
perl binary with this, it will make it miniscule. For example, on one
author's system, /usr/bin/perl is only 11k in size!

For

<P>

<PRE>    extproc perl -S -your_switches
</PRE>

<P>

as the first line in <CODE>*.cmd</CODE> file (<A HREF="#item__S">-S</A> due to a bug in cmd.exe's `extproc' handling). For 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DOS</FONT> one should first invent a corresponding batch
file, and codify it in <CODE>ALTERNATIVE_SHEBANG</CODE> (see the
<EM>INSTALL</EM> file in the source distribution for more information).


<P>

The Win95/NT installation, when using the Activeware port of Perl, will
modify the Registry to associate the .pl extension with the perl
interpreter. If you install another port, or (eventually) build your own
Win95/NT Perl using WinGCC, then you'll have to modify the Registry
yourself.


<P>

Macintosh perl scripts will have the the appropriate Creator and Type, so
that double-clicking them will invoke the perl application.


<P>

<EM>IMPORTANT!</EM>: Whatever you do, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PLEASE</FONT> don't get frustrated, and just throw the perl interpreter into your cgi-bin directory, in order to get your scripts working for a web server. This is an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>EXTREMELY</FONT> big security risk. Take the time to figure out how to do it correctly.

Yes. Read <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlrun.html#">the perlrun manpage</A> for more information. Some examples follow. (These assume standard Unix
shell quoting rules.)

Ok, the last one was actually an obfuscated perl entry. :-)

<H2><A NAME="Why_don_t_perl_one_liners_work_o">Why don't perl one-liners work on my DOS/Mac/VMS system?

</A></H2>
The problem is usually that the command interpreters on those systems have
rather different ideas about quoting than the Unix shells under which the
one-liners were created. On some systems, you may have to change
single-quotes to double ones, which you must <EM>NOT</EM> do on Unix or Plan9 systems. You might also have to change a single % to a
%%.


<P>

For example:


<P>

<PRE>    # Unix
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # DOS, etc.
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # Mac
    print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;
     (then Run &quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # VMS
    perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends on the command interpreter. Under Unix, the first two often work. Under 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DOS,</FONT> it's entirely possible neither works. If 
<FONT SIZE=-1>4DOS</FONT> was the command shell, I'd probably have better luck like this:



<P>

<PRE>  perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

Under the Mac, it depends which environment you are using. The MacPerl shell, or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MPW,</FONT> is much like Unix shells in its support for several quoting variants, except that it makes free use of the Mac's non-ASCII characters as control characters.



<P>

I'm afraid that there is no general solution to all of this. It is a mess,
pure and simple.
