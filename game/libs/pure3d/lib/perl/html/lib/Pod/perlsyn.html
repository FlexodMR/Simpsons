<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> Perl script consists of a sequence of declarations
and statements. The only things that need to be declared in Perl are report
formats and subroutines. See the sections below for more information on
those declarations. All uninitialized user-created objects are assumed to
start with a null or 0 value until they are defined by some explicit
operation such as assignment. (Though you can get warnings about the use of
undefined values if you like.) The sequence of statements is executed just
once, unlike in <STRONG>sed</STRONG> and <STRONG>awk</STRONG> scripts, where the sequence of statements is executed for each input line.
While this means that you must explicitly loop over the lines of your input
file (or files), it also means you have much more control over which files
and which lines you look at. (Actually, I'm lying--it is possible to do an
implicit loop with either the <STRONG>-n</STRONG> or <STRONG>-p</STRONG> switch. It's just not the mandatory default like it is in <STRONG>sed</STRONG> and <STRONG>awk</STRONG>.)


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Declarations">Declarations

</A></H2>
Perl is, for the most part, a free-form language. (The only exception to
this is format declarations, for obvious reasons.) Comments are indicated
by the ``#'' character, and extend to the end of the line. If you attempt
to use <CODE>/* */</CODE> C-style comments, it will be interpreted either as division or pattern matching, depending on the context, and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C++</FONT>

<CODE>//</CODE> comments just look like a null regular expression, so don't do that.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> declaration can be put anywhere a statement can, but
has no effect on the execution of the primary sequence of
statements--declarations all take effect at compile time. Typically all the
declarations are put at the beginning or the end of the script. However, if
you're using lexically-scoped private variables created with
<CODE>my(),</CODE> you'll have to make sure your format or subroutine
definition is within the same block scope as the my if you expect to be
able to access those private variables.


<P>

Declaring a subroutine allows a subroutine name to be used as if it were a
list operator from that point forward in the program. You can declare a
subroutine without defining it by saying <CODE>sub name</CODE>, thus:


<P>

<PRE>    sub myname;
    $me = myname $0             or die &quot;can't get myname&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Note that it functions as a list operator, not as a unary operator; so be
careful to use <CODE>or</CODE> instead of <CODE>||</CODE> in this case. However, if you were to declare the subroutine as <CODE>sub myname ($)</CODE>, then
<CODE>myname</CODE> would functonion as a unary operator, so either <CODE>or</CODE> or
<CODE>||</CODE> would work.


<P>

Subroutines declarations can also be loaded up with the <A HREF="#item_require">require</A> statement or both loaded and imported into your namespace with a <A HREF="#item_use">use</A> statement. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlmod.html#">the perlmod manpage</A> for details on this.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> statement sequence may contain declarations of
lexically-scoped variables, but apart from declaring a variable name, the
declaration acts like an ordinary statement, and is elaborated within the
sequence of statements as if it were an ordinary statement. That means it
actually has both compile-time and run-time effects.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Simple_statements">Simple statements

</A></H2>
The only kind of simple statement is an expression evaluated for its side effects. Every simple statement must be terminated with a semicolon, unless it is the final statement in a block, in which case the semicolon is optional. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(A</FONT> semicolon is still encouraged there if the block takes up more than one line, because you may eventually add another line.) Note that there are some operators like
 <A HREF="#item_eval_">eval {}</A> and <A HREF="#item_do_">do {}</A> that look like compound statements, but aren't (they're just TERMs in an
expression), and thus need an explicit termination if used as the last item
in a statement.


<P>

Any simple statement may optionally be followed by a <EM>SINGLE</EM> modifier, just before the terminating semicolon (or block ending). The
possible modifiers are:


<P>

<PRE>    if EXPR
    unless EXPR
    while EXPR
    until EXPR
</PRE>

<P>

The <CODE>if</CODE> and <CODE>unless</CODE> modifiers have the expected semantics, presuming you're a speaker of
English. The <CODE>while</CODE> and <CODE>until</CODE>
modifiers also have the usual ``while loop'' semantics (conditional
evaluated first), except when applied to a do-BLOCK (or to the
now-deprecated do-SUBROUTINE statement), in which case the block executes
once before the conditional is evaluated. This is so that you can write
loops like:


<P>

<PRE>    do {
        $line = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
        ...
    } until $line  eq &quot;.\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#do">do</A>. Note also that the loop control statements described later will <EM>NOT</EM> work in this construct, because modifiers don't take loop labels. Sorry.
You can always wrap another block around it to do that sort of thing.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Compound_statements">Compound statements

</A></H2>
In Perl, a sequence of statements that defines a scope is called a block.
Sometimes a block is delimited by the file containing it (in the case of a
required file, or the program as a whole), and sometimes a block is
delimited by the extent of a string (in the case of an eval).


<P>

But generally, a block is delimited by curly brackets, also known as braces. We will call this syntactic construct a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BLOCK.</FONT>



<P>

The following compound statements may be used to control flow:


<P>

<PRE>    if (EXPR) BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK
    LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK
    LABEL for (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK
    LABEL BLOCK continue BLOCK
</PRE>

<P>

Note that, unlike 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> and Pascal, these are defined in terms of BLOCKs,
not statements. This means that the curly brackets are <EM>required</EM>--no dangling statements allowed. If you want to write conditionals without
curly brackets there are several other ways to do it. The following all do
the same thing:


<P>

<PRE>    if (!open(FOO)) { die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot;; }
    die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot; unless open(FOO);
    open(FOO) or die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot;;     # FOO or bust!
    open(FOO) ? 'hi mom' : die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot;;
                        # a bit exotic, that last one
</PRE>

<P>

The <CODE>if</CODE> statement is straightforward. Because BLOCKs are always bounded by curly
brackets, there is never any ambiguity about which
<CODE>if</CODE> an <CODE>else</CODE> goes with. If you use <CODE>unless</CODE> in place of <CODE>if</CODE>, the sense of the test is reversed.


<P>

The <CODE>while</CODE> statement executes the block as long as the expression is true (does not evaluate to the null string or 0 or ``0''). The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LABEL</FONT> is optional, and if present, consists of an identifier followed by a colon. The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LABEL</FONT> identifies the loop for the loop control statements
 <A HREF="#item_next">next</A>,
<A HREF="#item_last">last</A>, and <A HREF="#item_redo">redo</A>. If the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LABEL</FONT> is omitted, the loop control statement refers to the innermost enclosing loop. This may include dynamically looking back your call-stack at run time to find the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LABEL.</FONT> Such desperate behavior triggers a warning if you use the
 <STRONG>-w</STRONG> flag.


<P>

If there is a <A HREF="#item_continue">continue</A> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BLOCK,</FONT> it is always executed just before the
conditional is about to be evaluated again, just like the third part of a
<CODE>for</CODE> loop in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C.</FONT> Thus it can be used to increment a loop variable,
even when the loop has been continued via the <A HREF="#item_next">next</A> statement (which is similar to the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> <A HREF="#item_continue">continue</A> statement).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Loop_Control">Loop Control

</A></H2>
The <A HREF="#item_next">next</A> command is like the <A HREF="#item_continue">continue</A> statement in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C;</FONT> it starts the next iteration of the loop:


<P>

<PRE>    LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        next LINE if /^#/;      # discard comments
        ...
    }
</PRE>

<P>

The <A HREF="#item_last">last</A> command is like the <CODE>break</CODE> statement in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> (as used in loops); it immediately exits the loop in
question. The
<A HREF="#item_continue">continue</A> block, if any, is not executed:


<P>

<PRE>    LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        last LINE if /^$/;      # exit when done with header
        ...
    }
</PRE>

<P>

The <A HREF="#item_redo">redo</A> command restarts the loop block without evaluating the conditional again.
The <A HREF="#item_continue">continue</A> block, if any, is <EM>not</EM> executed. This command is normally used by programs that want to lie to
themselves about what was just input.


<P>

For example, when processing a file like <EM>/etc/termcap</EM>. If your input lines might end in backslashes to indicate continuation,
you want to skip ahead and get the next record.


<P>

<PRE>    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        chomp;
        if (s/\\$//) {
            $_ .= &lt;&gt;;
            redo unless eof();
        }
        # now process $_
    }
</PRE>

<P>

which is Perl short-hand for the more explicitly written version:


<P>

<PRE>    LINE: while (defined($line = &lt;ARGV&gt;)) {
        chomp($line);
        if ($line =~ s/\\$//) {
            $line .= &lt;ARGV&gt;;
            redo LINE unless eof(); # not eof(ARGV)!
        }
        # now process $line
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Or here's a simpleminded Pascal comment stripper (warning: assumes no { or
} in strings).


<P>

<PRE>    LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        while (s|({.*}.*){.*}|$1 |) {}
        s|{.*}| |;
        if (s|{.*| |) {
            $front = $_;
            while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
                if (/}/) {      # end of comment?
                    s|^|$front{|;
                    redo LINE;
                }
            }
        }
        print;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Note that if there were a <A HREF="#item_continue">continue</A> block on the above code, it would get executed even on discarded lines.


<P>

If the word <CODE>while</CODE> is replaced by the word <CODE>until</CODE>, the sense of the test is reversed, but the conditional is still tested
before the first iteration.


<P>

The form <CODE>while/if BLOCK BLOCK</CODE>, available in Perl 4, is no longer available. Replace any occurrence of <CODE>if BLOCK</CODE> by <CODE>if (do BLOCK)</CODE>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="For_Loops">For Loops

</A></H2>
Perl's C-style <CODE>for</CODE> loop works exactly like the corresponding <CODE>while</CODE> loop; that means that this:


<P>

<PRE>    for ($i = 1; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
        ...
    }
</PRE>

<P>

is the same as this:


<P>

<PRE>    $i = 1;
    while ($i &lt; 10) {
        ...
    } continue {
        $i++;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

(There is one minor difference: The first form implies a lexical scope for
variables declared with <A HREF="#item_my">my</A> in the initialization expression.)


<P>

Besides the normal array index looping, <CODE>for</CODE> can lend itself to many other interesting applications. Here's one that
avoids the problem you get into if you explicitly test for end-of-file on
an interactive file descriptor causing your program to appear to hang.


<P>

<PRE>    $on_a_tty = -t STDIN &amp;&amp; -t STDOUT;
    sub prompt { print &quot;yes? &quot; if $on_a_tty }
    for ( prompt(); &lt;STDIN&gt;; prompt() ) {
        # do something
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Foreach_Loops">Foreach Loops

</A></H2>
The <CODE>foreach</CODE> loop iterates over a normal list value and sets the variable 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VAR</FONT> to be each element of the list in turn. If the
variable is preceded with the keyword <A HREF="#item_my">my</A>, then it is lexically scoped, and is therefore visible only within the
loop. Otherwise, the variable is implicitly local to the loop and regains
its former value upon exiting the loop. If the variable was previously
declared with <A HREF="#item_my">my</A>, it uses that variable instead of the global one, but it's still localized
to the loop. (Note that a lexically scoped variable can cause problems with
you have subroutine or format declarations.)


<P>

The <CODE>foreach</CODE> keyword is actually a synonym for the <CODE>for</CODE> keyword, so you can use <CODE>foreach</CODE> for readability or <CODE>for</CODE> for brevity. If 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VAR</FONT> is omitted, <CODE>$_</CODE> is set to each value. If 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LIST</FONT> is an actual array (as opposed to an expression returning a list value), you can modify each element of the array by modifying 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VAR</FONT> inside the loop. That's because the
 <CODE>foreach</CODE>
loop index variable is an implicit alias for each item in the list that
you're looping over.


<P>

Examples:


<P>

<PRE>    for (@ary) { s/foo/bar/ }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    foreach my $elem (@elements) {
        $elem *= 2;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    for $count (10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,'BOOM') {
        print $count, &quot;\n&quot;; sleep(1);
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    for (1..15) { print &quot;Merry Christmas\n&quot;; }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    foreach $item (split(/:[\\\n:]*/, $ENV{TERMCAP})) {
        print &quot;Item: $item\n&quot;;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Here's how a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> programmer might code up a particular algorithm in
Perl:


<P>

<PRE>    for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; @ary1; $i++) {
        for (my $j = 0; $j &lt; @ary2; $j++) {
            if ($ary1[$i] &gt; $ary2[$j]) {
                last; # can't go to outer :-(
            }
            $ary1[$i] += $ary2[$j];
        }
        # this is where that last takes me
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Whereas here's how a Perl programmer more comfortable with the idiom might
do it:


<P>

<PRE>    OUTER: foreach my $wid (@ary1) {
    INNER:   foreach my $jet (@ary2) {
                next OUTER if $wid &gt; $jet;
                $wid += $jet;
             }
          }
</PRE>

<P>

See how much easier this is? It's cleaner, safer, and faster. It's cleaner
because it's less noisy. It's safer because if code gets added between the
inner and outer loops later on, the new code won't be accidentally
executed. The <A HREF="#item_next">next</A> explicitly iterates the other loop rather than merely terminating the inner
one. And it's faster because Perl executes a <CODE>foreach</CODE> statement more rapidly than it would the equivalent <CODE>for</CODE> loop.


<P>

<H2><A NAME="Basic_BLOCKs_and_Switch_Statemen">Basic BLOCKs and Switch Statements

</A></H2>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BLOCK</FONT> by itself (labeled or not) is semantically equivalent to a loop that executes once. Thus you can use any of the loop control statements in it to leave or restart the block. (Note that this is

<EM>NOT</EM> true in <A HREF="#item_eval_">eval{}</A>, <A HREF="#item_sub_">sub{}</A>, or contrary to popular belief
<A HREF="#item_do_">do{}</A> blocks, which do <EM>NOT</EM> count as loops.) The <A HREF="#item_continue">continue</A>
block is optional.


<P>

The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BLOCK</FONT> construct is particularly nice for doing case
structures.


<P>

<PRE>    SWITCH: {
        if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; }
        if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; }
        if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; }
        $nothing = 1;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

There is no official switch statement in Perl, because there are already
several ways to write the equivalent. In addition to the above, you could
write


<P>

<PRE>    SWITCH: {
        $abc = 1, last SWITCH  if /^abc/;
        $def = 1, last SWITCH  if /^def/;
        $xyz = 1, last SWITCH  if /^xyz/;
        $nothing = 1;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

(That's actually not as strange as it looks once you realize that you can use loop control ``operators'' within an expression, That's just the normal 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> comma operator.)



<P>

or


<P>

<PRE>    SWITCH: {
        /^abc/ &amp;&amp; do { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; };
        /^def/ &amp;&amp; do { $def = 1; last SWITCH; };
        /^xyz/ &amp;&amp; do { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; };
        $nothing = 1;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

or formatted so it stands out more as a ``proper'' switch statement:


<P>

<PRE>    SWITCH: {
        /^abc/      &amp;&amp; do {
                            $abc = 1;
                            last SWITCH;
                       };
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        /^def/      &amp;&amp; do {
                            $def = 1;
                            last SWITCH;
                       };
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        /^xyz/      &amp;&amp; do {
                            $xyz = 1;
                            last SWITCH;
                        };
        $nothing = 1;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

or


<P>

<PRE>    SWITCH: {
        /^abc/ and $abc = 1, last SWITCH;
        /^def/ and $def = 1, last SWITCH;
        /^xyz/ and $xyz = 1, last SWITCH;
        $nothing = 1;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

or even, horrors,


<P>

<PRE>    if (/^abc/)
        { $abc = 1 }
    elsif (/^def/)
        { $def = 1 }
    elsif (/^xyz/)
        { $xyz = 1 }
    else
        { $nothing = 1 }
</PRE>

<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> common idiom for a switch statement is to use <CODE>foreach</CODE>'s aliasing to make a temporary assignment to <CODE>$_</CODE> for
convenient matching:


<P>

<PRE>    SWITCH: for ($where) {
                /In Card Names/     &amp;&amp; do { push @flags, '-e'; last; };
                /Anywhere/          &amp;&amp; do { push @flags, '-h'; last; };
                /In Rulings/        &amp;&amp; do {                    last; };
                die &quot;unknown value for form variable where: `$where'&quot;;
            }
</PRE>

<P>

Another interesting approach to a switch statement is arrange for a <A HREF="#item_do">do</A> block to return the proper value:


<P>

<PRE>    $amode = do {
        if     ($flag &amp; O_RDONLY) { &quot;r&quot; }
        elsif  ($flag &amp; O_WRONLY) { ($flag &amp; O_APPEND) ? &quot;a&quot; : &quot;w&quot; }
        elsif  ($flag &amp; O_RDWR)   {
            if ($flag &amp; O_CREAT)  { &quot;w+&quot; }
            else                  { ($flag &amp; O_APPEND) ? &quot;a+&quot; : &quot;r+&quot; }
        }
    };
</PRE>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Goto">Goto

</A></H2>
Although not for the faint of heart, Perl does support a <A HREF="#item_goto">goto</A> statement. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> loop's 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LABEL</FONT> is not actually a valid target for a
 <A HREF="#item_goto">goto</A>; it's just the name of the loop. There are three forms: goto-LABEL,
goto-EXPR, and goto-&amp;NAME.


<P>

The goto-LABEL form finds the statement labeled with 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LABEL</FONT> and resumes execution there. It may not be used
to go into any construct that requires initialization, such as a subroutine
or a foreach loop. It also can't be used to go into a construct that is
optimized away. It can be used to go almost anywhere else within the
dynamic scope, including out of subroutines, but it's usually better to use
some other construct such as last or die. The author of Perl has never felt
the need to use this form of goto (in Perl, that is--C is another matter).


<P>

The goto-EXPR form expects a label name, whose scope will be resolved dynamically. This allows for computed gotos per 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FORTRAN,</FONT> but isn't necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:



<P>

<PRE>    goto (&quot;FOO&quot;, &quot;BAR&quot;, &quot;GLARCH&quot;)[$i];
</PRE>

<P>

The goto-&amp;NAME form is highly magical, and substitutes a call to the
named subroutine for the currently running subroutine. This is used by
<CODE>AUTOLOAD()</CODE> subroutines that wish to load another subroutine
and then pretend that the other subroutine had been called in the first
place (except that any modifications to <CODE>@_</CODE> in the current
subroutine are propagated to the other subroutine.) After the <A HREF="#item_goto">goto</A>, not even <CODE>caller()</CODE> will be able to tell that this routine was
called first.


<P>

In almost all cases like this, it's usually a far, far better idea to use
the structured control flow mechanisms of <A HREF="#item_next">next</A>, <A HREF="#item_last">last</A>, or <A HREF="#item_redo">redo</A> instead of resorting to a <A HREF="#item_goto">goto</A>. For certain applications, the catch and throw pair of
<A HREF="#item_eval_">eval{}</A> and <CODE>die()</CODE> for exception processing can also be a prudent
approach.

Perl has a mechanism for intermixing documentation with source code. While
it's expecting the beginning of a new statement, if the compiler encounters
a line that begins with an equal sign and a word, like this


<P>

<PRE>    =head1 Here There Be Pods!
</PRE>

<P>

Then that text and all remaining text up through and including a line
beginning with <CODE>=cut</CODE> will be ignored. The format of the intervening text is described in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlpod.html#">the perlpod manpage</A>.


<P>

This allows you to intermix your source code and your documentation text
freely, as in


<P>

<PRE>    =item snazzle($)
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    The snazzle() function will behave in the most spectacular
    form that you can possibly imagine, not even excepting
    cybernetic pyrotechnics.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    =cut back to the compiler, nuff of this pod stuff!
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    sub snazzle($) {
        my $thingie = shift;
        .........
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Note that pod translators should look at only paragraphs beginning with a
pod directive (it makes parsing easier), whereas the compiler actually
knows to look for pod escapes even in the middle of a paragraph. This means
that the following secret stuff will be ignored by both the compiler and
the translators.


<P>

<PRE>    $a=3;
    =secret stuff
     warn &quot;Neither POD nor CODE!?&quot;
    =cut back
    print &quot;got $a\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

You probably shouldn't rely upon the <CODE>warn()</CODE> being podded out
forever. Not all pod translators are well-behaved in this regard, and
perhaps the compiler will become pickier.


<P>

One may also use pod directives to quickly comment out a section of code.

Much like the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> preprocessor, perl can process line directives. Using this, one can control perl's idea of filenames and line numbers in error or warning messages (especially for strings that are processed with <CODE>eval()).</CODE> The syntax for this mechanism is the same as for most 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> preprocessors: it matches the regular expression

<CODE>/^#\s*line\s+(\d+)\s*(?:\s"([^"]*)")?/</CODE> with <CODE>$1</CODE> being the line number for the next line, and <CODE>$2</CODE> being the optional filename (specified within quotes).


<P>

Here are some examples that you should be able to type into your command
shell:


<P>

<PRE>    % perl
    # line 200 &quot;bzzzt&quot;
    # the `#' on the previous line must be the first char on line
    die 'foo';
    __END__
    foo at bzzzt line 201.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    % perl
    # line 200 &quot;bzzzt&quot;
    eval qq[\n#line 2001 &quot;&quot;\ndie 'foo']; print $@;
    __END__
    foo at - line 2001.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    % perl
    eval qq[\n#line 200 &quot;foo bar&quot;\ndie 'foo']; print $@;
    __END__
    foo at foo bar line 200.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    % perl
    # line 345 &quot;goop&quot;
    eval &quot;\n#line &quot; . __LINE__ . ' &quot;' . __FILE__ .&quot;\&quot;\ndie 'foo'&quot;;
    print $@;
    __END__
    foo at goop line 345.
