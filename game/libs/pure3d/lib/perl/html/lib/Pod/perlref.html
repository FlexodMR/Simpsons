perlref - Perl references and nested data structures


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
Before release 5 of Perl it was difficult to represent complex data
structures, because all references had to be symbolic, and even that was
difficult to do when you wanted to refer to a variable rather than a symbol
table entry. Perl not only makes it easier to use symbolic references to
variables, but lets you have ``hard'' references to any piece of data. Any
scalar may hold a hard reference. Because arrays and hashes contain
scalars, you can now easily build arrays of arrays, arrays of hashes,
hashes of arrays, arrays of hashes of functions, and so on.


<P>

Hard references are smart--they keep track of reference counts for you,
automatically freeing the thing referred to when its reference count goes
to zero. (Note: The reference counts for values in self-referential or
cyclic data structures may not go to zero without a little help; see
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlobj.html#Two_Phased_Garbage_Collection">Two-Phased Garbage Collection</A> for a detailed explanation. If that thing happens to be an object, the
object is destructed. See
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlobj.html#">the perlobj manpage</A> for more about objects. (In a sense, everything in Perl is an object, but
we usually reserve the word for references to objects that have been
officially ``blessed'' into a class package.)


<P>

Symbolic references are names of variables or other objects, just as a
symbolic link in a Unix filesystem contains merely the name of a file. The <A HREF="#item__glob">*glob</A> notation is a kind of symbolic reference. (Symbolic references are
sometimes called ``soft references'', but please don't call them that;
references are confusing enough without useless synonyms.)


<P>

In contrast, hard references are more like hard links in a Unix file
system: They are used to access an underlying object without concern for
what its (other) name is. When the word ``reference'' is used without an
adjective, like in the following paragraph, it usually is talking about a
hard reference.


<P>

References are easy to use in Perl. There is just one overriding principle:
Perl does no implicit referencing or dereferencing. When a scalar is
holding a reference, it always behaves as a simple scalar. It doesn't
magically start being an array or hash or subroutine; you have to tell it
explicitly to do so, by dereferencing it.


<P>

References can be constructed in several ways.


<P>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
By using the backslash operator on a variable, subroutine, or value. (This works much like the &amp; (address-of) operator in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C.)</FONT> Note that this typically creates
 <EM>ANOTHER</EM> reference to a variable, because there's already a reference to the
variable in the symbol table. But the symbol table reference might go away,
and you'll still have the reference that the backslash returned. Here are
some examples:


<P>

<PRE>    $scalarref = \$foo;
    $arrayref  = \@ARGV;
    $hashref   = \%ENV;
    $coderef   = \&amp;handler;
    $globref   = \*foo;
</PRE>

<P>

It isn't possible to create a true reference to an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>IO</FONT> handle (filehandle or dirhandle) using the backslash operator. See the explanation of the *foo{THING} syntax below. (However, you're apt to find Perl code out there using globrefs as though they were 
<FONT SIZE=-1>IO</FONT> handles, which is grandfathered into continued functioning.)



<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> reference to an anonymous array can be constructed
using square brackets:


<P>

<PRE>    $arrayref = [1, 2, ['a', 'b', 'c']];
</PRE>

<P>

Here we've constructed a reference to an anonymous array of three elements
whose final element is itself a reference to another anonymous array of
three elements. (The multidimensional syntax described later can be used to
access this. For example, after the above, <CODE>$arrayref-&gt;[2][1]</CODE> would have the value ``b''.)


<P>

Note that taking a reference to an enumerated list is not the same as using
square brackets--instead it's the same as creating a list of references!


<P>

<PRE>    @list = (\$a, \@b, \%c);
    @list = \($a, @b, %c);      # same thing!
</PRE>

<P>

As a special case, <CODE>\(@foo)</CODE> returns a list of references to the contents of <CODE>@foo</CODE>, not a reference to <CODE>@foo</CODE> itself. Likewise for <CODE>%foo</CODE>.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> reference to an anonymous hash can be constructed
using curly brackets:


<P>

<PRE>    $hashref = {
        'Adam'  =&gt; 'Eve',
        'Clyde' =&gt; 'Bonnie',
    };
</PRE>

<P>

Anonymous hash and array constructors can be intermixed freely to produce
as complicated a structure as you want. The multidimensional syntax
described below works for these too. The values above are literals, but
variables and expressions would work just as well, because assignment
operators in Perl (even within <CODE>local()</CODE> or <CODE>my())</CODE>
are executable statements, not compile-time declarations.


<P>

Because curly brackets (braces) are used for several other things including
BLOCKs, you may occasionally have to disambiguate braces at the beginning
of a statement by putting a <CODE>+</CODE> or a <A HREF="#item_return">return</A> in front so that Perl realizes the opening brace isn't starting a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BLOCK.</FONT> The economy and mnemonic value of using curlies
is deemed worth this occasional extra hassle.


<P>

For example, if you wanted a function to make a new hash and return a
reference to it, you have these options:


<P>

<PRE>    sub hashem {        { @_ } }   # silently wrong
    sub hashem {       +{ @_ } }   # ok
    sub hashem { return { @_ } }   # ok
</PRE>

<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> reference to an anonymous subroutine can be
constructed by using
<A HREF="#item_sub">sub</A> without a subname:


<P>

<PRE>    $coderef = sub { print &quot;Boink!\n&quot; };
</PRE>

<P>

Note the presence of the semicolon. Except for the fact that the code
inside isn't executed immediately, a <A HREF="#item_sub_">sub {}</A> is not so much a declaration as it is an operator, like <A HREF="#item_do_">do{}</A> or <A HREF="#item_eval_">eval{}</A>. (However, no matter how many times you execute that line (unless you're
in an
<A HREF="#item_eval">eval("...")</A>), <CODE>$coderef</CODE> will still have a reference to the <EM>SAME</EM>
anonymous subroutine.)


<P>

Anonymous subroutines act as closures with respect to <CODE>my()</CODE>
variables, that is, variables visible lexically within the current scope.
Closure is a notion out of the Lisp world that says if you define an
anonymous function in a particular lexical context, it pretends to run in
that context even when it's called outside of the context.


<P>

In human terms, it's a funny way of passing arguments to a subroutine when
you define it as well as when you call it. It's useful for setting up
little bits of code to run later, such as callbacks. You can even do
object-oriented stuff with it, though Perl already provides a different
mechanism to do that--see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlobj.html#">the perlobj manpage</A>.


<P>

You can also think of closure as a way to write a subroutine template
without using eval. (In fact, in version 5.000, eval was the <EM>only</EM> way to get closures. You may wish to use ``require 5.001'' if you use
closures.)


<P>

Here's a small example of how closures works:


<P>

<PRE>    sub newprint {
        my $x = shift;
        return sub { my $y = shift; print &quot;$x, $y!\n&quot;; };
    }
    $h = newprint(&quot;Howdy&quot;);
    $g = newprint(&quot;Greetings&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # Time passes...
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    &amp;$h(&quot;world&quot;);
    &amp;$g(&quot;earthlings&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

This prints


<P>

<PRE>    Howdy, world!
    Greetings, earthlings!
</PRE>

<P>

Note particularly that <A HREF="#item__x">$x</A> continues to refer to the
value passed into <CODE>newprint()</CODE> <EM>despite</EM> the fact that the ``my $x'' has seemingly gone out of scope by the time the
anonymous subroutine runs. That's what closure is all about.


<P>

This applies to only lexical variables, by the way. Dynamic variables
continue to work as they have always worked. Closure is not something that
most Perl programmers need trouble themselves about to begin with.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
References are often returned by special subroutines called constructors.
Perl objects are just references to a special kind of object that happens
to know which package it's associated with. Constructors are just special
subroutines that know how to create that association. They do so by
starting with an ordinary reference, and it remains an ordinary reference
even while it's also being an object. Constructors are customarily named
<CODE>new(),</CODE> but don't have to be:


<P>

<PRE>    $objref = new Doggie (Tail =&gt; 'short', Ears =&gt; 'long');
</PRE>

<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
References of the appropriate type can spring into existence if you
dereference them in a context that assumes they exist. Because we haven't
talked about dereferencing yet, we can't show you any examples yet.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> reference can be created by using a special syntax, lovingly known as the *foo{THING} syntax. *foo{THING} returns a reference to the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>THING</FONT> slot in <CODE>*foo</CODE> (which is the symbol table entry which holds everything known as foo).



<P>

<PRE>    $scalarref = *foo{SCALAR};
    $arrayref  = *ARGV{ARRAY};
    $hashref   = *ENV{HASH};
    $coderef   = *handler{CODE};
    $ioref     = *STDIN{IO};
    $globref   = *foo{GLOB};
</PRE>

<P>

All of these are self-explanatory except for *foo{IO}. It returns the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>IO</FONT> handle, used for file handles (<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#open">open</A>), sockets (<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#socket">socket</A> and <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#socketpair">socketpair</A>), and directory handles (<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#opendir">opendir</A>). For compatibility with previous versions of Perl, *foo{FILEHANDLE} is a
synonym for *foo{IO}.


<P>

*foo{THING} returns undef if that particular 
<FONT SIZE=-1>THING</FONT> hasn't been used yet, except in the case of
scalars. *foo{SCALAR} returns a reference to an anonymous scalar if
<CODE>$foo</CODE> hasn't been used yet. This might change in a future
release.


<P>

The use of *foo{IO} is the best way to pass bareword filehandles into or
out of subroutines, or to store them in larger data structures.


<P>

<PRE>    splutter(*STDOUT{IO});
    sub splutter {
        my $fh = shift;
        print $fh &quot;her um well a hmmm\n&quot;;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $rec = get_rec(*STDIN{IO});
    sub get_rec {
        my $fh = shift;
        return scalar &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Beware, though, that you can't do this with a routine which is going to open the filehandle for you, because 
<FONT SIZE=-1>*HANDLE{IO}</FONT> will be undef if 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HANDLE</FONT> hasn't been used yet. Use 
<FONT SIZE=-1>\*HANDLE</FONT> for that sort of thing instead.



<P>

Using 
<FONT SIZE=-1>\*HANDLE</FONT> (or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>*HANDLE)</FONT> is another way to use and store non-bareword filehandles (before perl version 5.002 it was the only way). The two methods are largely interchangeable, you can do



<P>

<PRE>    splutter(\*STDOUT);
    $rec = get_rec(\*STDIN);
</PRE>

<P>

with the above subroutine definitions.


<P>

</OL>
That's it for creating references. By now you're probably dying to know how
to use references to get back to your long-lost data. There are several
basic methods.


<P>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
Anywhere you'd put an identifier (or chain of identifiers) as part of a
variable or subroutine name, you can replace the identifier with a simple
scalar variable containing a reference of the correct type:


<P>

<PRE>    $bar = $$scalarref;
    push(@$arrayref, $filename);
    $$arrayref[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
    $$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;
    &amp;$coderef(1,2,3);
    print $globref &quot;output\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

It's important to understand that we are specifically <EM>NOT</EM> dereferencing
<CODE>$arrayref[0]</CODE> or <CODE>$hashref{"KEY"}</CODE> there. The dereference of the scalar variable happens <EM>BEFORE</EM> it does any key lookups. Anything more complicated than a simple scalar
variable must use methods 2 or 3 below. However, a ``simple scalar''
includes an identifier that itself uses method 1 recursively. Therefore,
the following prints ``howdy''.


<P>

<PRE>    $refrefref = \\\&quot;howdy&quot;;
    print $$$$refrefref;
</PRE>

<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
Anywhere you'd put an identifier (or chain of identifiers) as part of a variable or subroutine name, you can replace the identifier with a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BLOCK</FONT> returning a reference of the correct type. In other words, the previous examples could be written like this:



<P>

<PRE>    $bar = ${$scalarref};
    push(@{$arrayref}, $filename);
    ${$arrayref}[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
    ${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;
    &amp;{$coderef}(1,2,3);
    $globref-&gt;print(&quot;output\n&quot;);  # iff IO::Handle is loaded
</PRE>

<P>

Admittedly, it's a little silly to use the curlies in this case, but the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BLOCK</FONT> can contain any arbitrary expression, in
particular, subscripted expressions:


<P>

<PRE>    &amp;{ $dispatch{$index} }(1,2,3);      # call correct routine
</PRE>

<P>

Because of being able to omit the curlies for the simple case of <A HREF="#item__x">$$x</A>, people often make the mistake of viewing the dereferencing symbols as
proper operators, and wonder about their precedence. If they were, though,
you could use parentheses instead of braces. That's not the case. Consider
the difference below; case 0 is a short-hand version of case 1,
<EM>NOT</EM> case 2:


<P>

<PRE>    $$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}   = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 0
    ${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 1
    ${$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 2
    ${$hashref-&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;     # CASE 3
</PRE>

<P>

Case 2 is also deceptive in that you're accessing a variable called
%hashref, not dereferencing through <CODE>$hashref</CODE> to the hash it's
presumably referencing. That would be case 3.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
Subroutine calls and lookups of individual array elements arise often
enough that it gets cumbersome to use method 2. As a form of syntactic
sugar, the examples for method 2 may be written:


<P>

<PRE>    $arrayref-&gt;[0] = &quot;January&quot;;   # Array element
    $hashref-&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;  # Hash element
    $coderef-&gt;(1,2,3);            # Subroutine call
</PRE>

<P>

The left side of the arrow can be any expression returning a reference,
including a previous dereference. Note that <CODE>$array[$x]</CODE> is <EM>NOT</EM> the same thing as <CODE>$array-&gt;[$x]</CODE> here:


<P>

<PRE>    $array[$x]-&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}-&gt;[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

This is one of the cases we mentioned earlier in which references could
spring into existence when in an lvalue context. Before this statement, <CODE>$array[$x]</CODE> may have been undefined. If so, it's automatically defined with a hash
reference so that we can look up
<CODE>{"foo"}</CODE> in it. Likewise <CODE>$array[$x]-&gt;{"foo"}</CODE> will automatically get defined with an array reference so that we can look
up <CODE>[0]</CODE> in it.


<P>

One more thing here. The arrow is optional <EM>BETWEEN</EM> brackets subscripts, so you can shrink the above down to


<P>

<PRE>    $array[$x]{&quot;foo&quot;}[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Which, in the degenerate case of using only ordinary arrays, gives you
multidimensional arrays just like C's:


<P>

<PRE>    $score[$x][$y][$z] += 42;
</PRE>

<P>

Well, okay, not entirely like C's arrays, actually. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> doesn't know how to grow its arrays on demand. Perl
does.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
If a reference happens to be a reference to an object, then there are
probably methods to access the things referred to, and you should probably
stick to those methods unless you're in the class package that defines the
object's methods. In other words, be nice, and don't violate the object's
encapsulation without a very good reason. Perl does not enforce
encapsulation. We are not totalitarians here. We do expect some basic
civility though.


<P>

</OL>
The <CODE>ref()</CODE> operator may be used to determine what type of thing
the reference is pointing to. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#">the perlfunc manpage</A>.


<P>

The <CODE>bless()</CODE> operator may be used to associate a reference with
a package functioning as an object class. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlobj.html#">the perlobj manpage</A>.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> typeglob may be dereferenced the same way a
reference can, because the dereference syntax always indicates the kind of
reference desired. So <CODE>${*foo}</CODE> and <CODE>${\$foo}</CODE> both indicate the same scalar variable.


<P>

Here's a trick for interpolating a subroutine call into a string:


<P>

<PRE>    print &quot;My sub returned @{[mysub(1,2,3)]} that time.\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

The way it works is that when the <CODE>@{...}</CODE> is seen in the double-quoted string, it's evaluated as a block. The block
creates a reference to an anonymous array containing the results of the
call to <CODE>mysub(1,2,3)</CODE>. So the whole block returns a reference to an array, which is then
dereferenced by <CODE>@{...}</CODE> and stuck into the double-quoted string. This chicanery is also useful for
arbitrary expressions:


<P>

<PRE>    print &quot;That yields @{[$n + 5]} widgets\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="Symbolic_references">Symbolic references

</A></H2>
We said that references spring into existence as necessary if they are
undefined, but we didn't say what happens if a value used as a reference is
already defined, but <EM>ISN'T</EM> a hard reference. If you use it as a reference in this case, it'll be
treated as a symbolic reference. That is, the value of the scalar is taken
to be the <EM>NAME</EM>
of a variable, rather than a direct link to a (possibly) anonymous value.


<P>

People frequently expect it to work like this. So it does.


<P>

<PRE>    $name = &quot;foo&quot;;
    $$name = 1;                 # Sets $foo
    ${$name} = 2;               # Sets $foo
    ${$name x 2} = 3;           # Sets $foofoo
    $name-&gt;[0] = 4;             # Sets $foo[0]
    @$name = ();                # Clears @foo
    &amp;$name();                   # Calls &amp;foo() (as in Perl 4)
    $pack = &quot;THAT&quot;;
    ${&quot;${pack}::$name&quot;} = 5;    # Sets $THAT::foo without eval
</PRE>

<P>

This is very powerful, and slightly dangerous, in that it's possible to
intend (with the utmost sincerity) to use a hard reference, and
accidentally use a symbolic reference instead. To protect against that, you
can say


<P>

<PRE>    use strict 'refs';
</PRE>

<P>

and then only hard references will be allowed for the rest of the enclosing
block. An inner block may countermand that with


<P>

<PRE>    no strict 'refs';
</PRE>

<P>

Only package variables are visible to symbolic references. Lexical
variables (declared with <CODE>my())</CODE> aren't in a symbol table, and
thus are invisible to this mechanism. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    local($value) = 10;
    $ref = \$value;
    {
        my $value = 20;
        print $$ref;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

This will still print 10, not 20. Remember that <CODE>local()</CODE>
affects package variables, which are all ``global'' to the package.


<P>

<H2><A NAME="Not_so_symbolic_references">Not-so-symbolic references

</A></H2>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> new feature contributing to readability in perl
version 5.001 is that the brackets around a symbolic reference behave more
like quotes, just as they always have within a string. That is,


<P>

<PRE>    $push = &quot;pop on &quot;;
    print &quot;${push}over&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

has always meant to print ``pop on over'', despite the fact that push is a
reserved word. This has been generalized to work the same outside of
quotes, so that


<P>

<PRE>    print ${push} . &quot;over&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

and even


<P>

<PRE>    print ${ push } . &quot;over&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

will have the same effect. (This would have been a syntax error in Perl
5.000, though Perl 4 allowed it in the spaceless form.) Note that this
construct is <EM>not</EM> considered to be a symbolic reference when you're using strict refs:


<P>

<PRE>    use strict 'refs';
    ${ bareword };      # Okay, means $bareword.
    ${ &quot;bareword&quot; };    # Error, symbolic reference.
</PRE>

<P>

Similarly, because of all the subscripting that is done using single words,
we've applied the same rule to any bareword that is used for subscripting a
hash. So now, instead of writing


<P>

<PRE>    $array{ &quot;aaa&quot; }{ &quot;bbb&quot; }{ &quot;ccc&quot; }
</PRE>

<P>

you can write just


<P>

<PRE>    $array{ aaa }{ bbb }{ ccc }
</PRE>

<P>

and not worry about whether the subscripts are reserved words. In the rare
event that you do wish to do something like


<P>

<PRE>    $array{ shift }
</PRE>

<P>

you can force interpretation as a reserved word by adding anything that
makes it more than a bareword:


<P>

<PRE>    $array{ shift() }
    $array{ +shift }
    $array{ shift @_ }
</PRE>

<P>

The <STRONG>-w</STRONG> switch will warn you if it interprets a reserved word as a string. But it
will no longer warn you about using lowercase words, because the string is
effectively quoted.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="WARNING">WARNING

</A></H1>
You may not (usefully) use a reference as the key to a hash. It will be
converted into a string:


<P>

<PRE>    $x{ \$a } = $a;
</PRE>

<P>

If you try to dereference the key, it won't do a hard dereference, and you
won't accomplish what you're attempting. You might want to do something
more like


<P>

<PRE>    $r = \@a;
    $x{ $r } = $r;
</PRE>

<P>

And then at least you can use the <CODE>values(),</CODE> which will be real
refs, instead of the <CODE>keys(),</CODE> which won't.
