perlfaq8 - System Interaction ($Revision: 1.21 $, $Date: 1997/04/24
22:44:19 $)


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
This section of the Perl 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ</FONT> covers questions involving operating system interaction. This involves interprocess communication 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(IPC),</FONT> control over the user-interface (keyboard, screen and pointing devices), and most anything else not related to data manipulation.



<P>

Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your
operating system (eg, <EM>perlvms</EM>, <EM>perlplan9</EM>, ...). These should contain more detailed information on the vagaries of
your perl.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_find_out_which_operatin">How do I find out which operating system I'm running under?

</A></H2>
The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>$^O</FONT> variable 
<FONT SIZE=-1>($OSTYPE</FONT> if you use English) contains the operating system that your perl binary was built for.



<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_come_exec_doesn_t_return_">How come exec() doesn't return?

</A></H2>
Because that's what it does: it replaces your currently running program
with a different one. If you want to keep going (as is probably the case if
you're asking this question) use <CODE>system()</CODE> instead.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_do_fancy_stuff_with_the">How do I do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse?

</A></H2>
How you access/control keyboards, screens, and pointing devices (``mice'')
is system-dependent. Try the following modules:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Keyboard">Keyboard

</A></STRONG><DD>
<PRE>    Term::Cap                   Standard perl distribution
    Term::ReadKey               CPAN
    Term::ReadLine::Gnu         CPAN
    Term::ReadLine::Perl        CPAN
    Term::Screen                CPAN
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Screen">Screen

</A></STRONG><DD>
<PRE>    Term::Cap                   Standard perl distribution
    Curses                      CPAN
    Term::ANSIColor             CPAN
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Mouse">Mouse

</A></STRONG><DD>
<PRE>    Tk                          CPAN
</PRE>

<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_ask_the_user_for_a_pass">How do I ask the user for a password?

</A></H2>
(This question has nothing to do with the web. See a different 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ</FONT> for that.)


<P>

There's an example of this in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#crypt">crypt</A>). First, you put the terminal into ``no echo'' mode, then just read the password normally. You may do this with an old-style <CODE>ioctl()</CODE> function, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>POSIX</FONT> terminal control (see
 <EM>POSIX</EM>, and Chapter 7 of the Camel), or a call to the <STRONG>stty</STRONG> program, with varying degrees of portability.


<P>

You can also do this for most systems using the Term::ReadKey module from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN,</FONT> which is easier to use and in theory more
portable.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_read_and_write_the_seri">How do I read and write the serial port?

</A></H2>
This depends on which operating system your program is running on. In the
case of Unix, the serial ports will be accessible through files in /dev; on
other systems, the devices names will doubtless differ. Several problem
areas common to all device interaction are the following


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_lockfiles">lockfiles

</A></STRONG><DD>
Your system may use lockfiles to control multiple access. Make sure you
follow the correct protocol. Unpredictable behaviour can result from
multiple processes reading from one device.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_open">open mode

</A></STRONG><DD>
If you expect to use both read and write operations on the device, you'll
have to open it for update (see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#open">open</A> for details). You may wish to open it without running the risk of blocking
by using <CODE>sysopen()</CODE> and <CODE>O_RDWR|O_NDELAY|O_NOCTTY</CODE> from the Fcntl module (part of the standard perl distribution). See
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#sysopen">sysopen</A> for more on this approach.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_end">end of line

</A></STRONG><DD>
Some devices will be expecting a ``\r'' at the end of each line rather than a ``\n''. In some ports of perl, ``\r'' and ``\n'' are different from their usual (Unix) 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> values of ``\012'' and ``\015''. You may have to give the numeric values you want directly, using octal (``\015''), hex (``0x0D''), or as a control-character specification (``\cM'').



<P>

<PRE>    print DEV &quot;atv1\012&quot;;       # wrong, for some devices
    print DEV &quot;atv1\015&quot;;       # right, for some devices
</PRE>

<P>

Even though with normal text files, a ``\n'' will do the trick, there is
still no unified scheme for terminating a line that is portable between
Unix, DOS/Win, and Macintosh, except to terminate <EM>ALL</EM> line ends with ``\015\012'', and strip what you don't need from the output. This applies especially to socket 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I/O</FONT> and autoflushing, discussed next.



<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_flushing">flushing output

</A></STRONG><DD>
If you expect characters to get to your device when you
<CODE>print()</CODE> them, you'll want to autoflush that filehandle, as in
the older


<P>

<PRE>    use FileHandle;
    DEV-&gt;autoflush(1);
</PRE>

<P>

and the newer


<P>

<PRE>    use IO::Handle;
    DEV-&gt;autoflush(1);
</PRE>

<P>

You can use <CODE>select()</CODE> and the <CODE>$|</CODE> variable to control autoflushing (see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlvar.html#_">$|</A> and <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#select">select</A>):


<P>

<PRE>    $oldh = select(DEV);
    $| = 1;
    select($oldh);
</PRE>

<P>

You'll also see code that does this without a temporary variable, as in


<P>

<PRE>    select((select(DEV), $| = 1)[0]);
</PRE>

<P>

As mentioned in the previous item, this still doesn't work when using socket 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I/O</FONT> between Unix and Macintosh. You'll need to hardcode your line terminators, in that case.



<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_non">non-blocking input

</A></STRONG><DD>
If you are doing a blocking <CODE>read()</CODE> or <CODE>sysread(),</CODE>
you'll have to arrange for an alarm handler to provide a timeout (see
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#alarm">alarm</A>). If you have a non-blocking open, you'll likely have a non-blocking read, which means you may have to use a 4-arg <CODE>select()</CODE> to determine whether 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I/O</FONT> is ready on that device (see

<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#select">select</A>.


<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_decode_encrypted_passwo">How do I decode encrypted password files?

</A></H2>
You spend lots and lots of money on dedicated hardware, but this is bound
to get you talked about.


<P>

Seriously, you can't if they are Unix password files - the Unix password
system employs one-way encryption. Programs like Crack can forcibly (and
intelligently) try to guess passwords, but don't (can't) guarantee quick
success.


<P>

If you're worried about users selecting bad passwords, you should
proactively check when they try to change their password (by modifying
<CODE>passwd(1),</CODE> for example).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_start_a_process_in_the_">How do I start a process in the background?

</A></H2>
You could use


<P>

<PRE>    system(&quot;cmd &amp;&quot;)
</PRE>

<P>

or you could use fork as documented in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#fork">fork</A>, with further examples in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlipc.html#">the perlipc manpage</A>. Some things to be aware of, if you're on a Unix-like system:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_STDIN">STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR are shared

</A></STRONG><DD>
Both the main process and the backgrounded one (the ``child'' process) share the same 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDIN,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT</FONT> and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDERR</FONT> filehandles. If both try to access them at once, strange things can happen. You may want to close or reopen these for the child. You can get around this with

<A HREF="#item_open">open</A>ing a pipe (see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#open">open</A>) but on some systems this means that the child process cannot outlive the
parent.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Signals">Signals

</A></STRONG><DD>
You'll have to catch the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIGCHLD</FONT> signal, and possibly 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIGPIPE</FONT> too. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIGCHLD</FONT> is sent when the backgrounded process finishes. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIGPIPE</FONT> is sent when you write to a filehandle whose child process has closed (an untrapped 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIGPIPE</FONT> can cause your program to silently die). This is not an issue with
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system">system("cmd&")</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Zombies">Zombies

</A></STRONG><DD>
You have to be prepared to ``reap'' the child process when it finishes


<P>

<PRE>    $SIG{CHLD} = sub { wait };
</PRE>

<P>

See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlipc.html#Signals">Signals</A> for other examples of code to do this. Zombies are not an issue with <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system">system("prog &")</A>.


<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_trap_control_characters">How do I trap control characters/signals?

</A></H2>
You don't actually ``trap'' a control character. Instead, that character
generates a signal, which you then trap. Signals are documented in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlipc.html#Signals">Signals</A> and chapter 6 of the Camel.


<P>

Be warned that very few 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> libraries are re-entrant. Therefore, if you attempt
to <CODE>print()</CODE> in a handler that got invoked during another stdio
operation your internal structures will likely be in an inconsistent state,
and your program will dump core. You can sometimes avoid this by using
<CODE>syswrite()</CODE> instead of <CODE>print().</CODE>


<P>

Unless you're exceedingly careful, the only safe things to do inside a
signal handler are: set a variable and exit. And in the first case, you
should only set a variable in such a way that <CODE>malloc()</CODE> is not
called (eg, by setting a variable that already has a value).


<P>

For example:


<P>

<PRE>    $Interrupted = 0;   # to ensure it has a value
    $SIG{INT} = sub {
        $Interrupted++;
        syswrite(STDERR, &quot;ouch\n&quot;, 5);
    }
</PRE>

<P>

However, because syscalls restart by default, you'll find that if you're in
a ``slow'' call, such as &lt;
<FONT SIZE=-1>FH</FONT>&gt;, <CODE>read(),</CODE> <CODE>connect(),</CODE> or <CODE>wait(),</CODE> that
the only way to terminate them is by ``longjumping'' out; that is, by
raising an exception. See the time-out handler for a blocking
<CODE>flock()</CODE> in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlipc.html#Signals">Signals</A> or chapter 6 of the Camel.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_modify_the_shadow_passw">How do I modify the shadow password file on a Unix system?

</A></H2>
If perl was installed correctly, the getpw*() functions described in
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#">the perlfunc manpage</A> provide (read-only) access to the shadow password file. To change the file,
make a new shadow password file (the format varies from system to system -
see <EM>passwd(5)</EM> for specifics) and use <CODE>pwd_mkdb(8)</CODE> to install it (see <EM>pwd_mkdb(5)</EM> for more details).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_set_the_time_and_date_">How do I set the time and date?

</A></H2>
Assuming you're running under sufficient permissions, you should be able to set the system-wide date and time by running the <CODE>date(1)</CODE> program. (There is no way to set the time and date on a per-process basis.) This mechanism will work for Unix, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MS-DOS,</FONT> Windows, and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NT;</FONT> the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS</FONT> equivalent is
 <CODE>set time</CODE>.


<P>

However, if all you want to do is change your timezone, you can probably
get away with setting an environment variable:


<P>

<PRE>    $ENV{TZ} = &quot;MST7MDT&quot;;                  # unixish
    $ENV{'SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL'}=&quot;-5&quot; # vms
    system &quot;trn comp.lang.perl&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_sleep_or_alarm_for">How can I sleep() or alarm() for under a second?

</A></H2>
If you want finer granularity than the 1 second that the
<CODE>sleep()</CODE> function provides, the easiest way is to use the
<CODE>select()</CODE> function as documented in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#select">select</A>. If your system has itimers and <CODE>syscall()</CODE> support, you can
check out the old example in <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/misc/ancient/tutorial/eg/itimers.pl">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/misc/ancient/tutorial/eg/itimers.pl</A>
.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_measure_time_under_a_s">How can I measure time under a second?

</A></H2>
In general, you may not be able to. The Time::HiRes module (available from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN)</FONT> provides this functionality for some systems.


<P>

In general, you may not be able to. But if you system supports both the
<CODE>syscall()</CODE> function in Perl as well as a system call like
<CODE>gettimeofday(2),</CODE> then you may be able to do something like
this:


<P>

<PRE>    require 'sys/syscall.ph';
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $TIMEVAL_T = &quot;LL&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $done = $start = pack($TIMEVAL_T, ());
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    syscall( &amp;SYS_gettimeofday, $start, 0)) != -1
               or die &quot;gettimeofday: $!&quot;;

    @done  = unpack($TIMEVAL_T, $done);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # fix microseconds
    for ($done[1], $start[1]) { $_ /= 1_000_000 }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $delta_time = sprintf &quot;%.4f&quot;, ($done[0]  + $done[1]  )
                                            -
                                 ($start[0] + $start[1] );
</PRE>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_do_an_atexit_or_setj">How can I do an atexit() or setjmp()/longjmp()? (Exception handling)

</A></H2>
Release 5 of Perl added the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>END</FONT> block, which can be used to simulate <CODE>atexit().</CODE> Each package's 
<FONT SIZE=-1>END</FONT> block is called when the program or thread ends (see
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlmod.html#">the perlmod manpage</A> manpage for more details). It isn't called when untrapped signals kill the program, though, so if you use 
<FONT SIZE=-1>END</FONT> blocks you should also use



<P>

<PRE>        use sigtrap qw(die normal-signals);
</PRE>

<P>

Perl's exception-handling mechanism is its <CODE>eval()</CODE> operator.
You can use <CODE>eval()</CODE> as setjmp and <CODE>die()</CODE> as
longjmp. For details of this, see the section on signals, especially the
time-out handler for a blocking <CODE>flock()</CODE> in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlipc.html#Signals">Signals</A> and chapter 6 of the Camel.


<P>

If exception handling is all you're interested in, try the exceptions.pl
library (part of the standard perl distribution).


<P>

If you want the <CODE>atexit()</CODE> syntax (and an <CODE>rmexit()</CODE> as well), try the AtExit module available from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN.</FONT>

<H2><A NAME="Why_doesn_t_my_sockets_program_w">Why doesn't my sockets program work under System V (Solaris)? What does the error message "Protocol not supported" mean?

</A></H2>
Some Sys-V based systems, notably Solaris 
<FONT SIZE=-1>2.X,</FONT> redefined some of the standard socket constants.
Since these were constant across all architectures, they were often
hardwired into perl code. The proper way to deal with this is to ``use
Socket'' to get the correct values.


<P>

Note that even though SunOS and Solaris are binary compatible, these values
are different. Go figure.

<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> with Perl? [h2xs, xsubpp]''. However, if the function is a system call, and your system supports <CODE>syscall(),</CODE> you can use the syscall function (documented in

<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#">the perlfunc manpage</A>).


<P>

Remember to check the modules that came with your distribution, and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> as well - someone may already have written a
module to do it.

Historically, these would be generated by the h2ph tool, part of the standard perl distribution. This program converts <CODE>cpp(1)</CODE> directives in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> header files to files containing subroutine definitions, like &amp;SYS_getitimer, which you can use as arguments to your functions. It doesn't work perfectly, but it usually gets most of the job done. Simple files like
 <EM>errno.h</EM>, <EM>syscall.h</EM>, and <EM>socket.h</EM> were fine, but the hard ones like <EM>ioctl.h</EM> nearly always need to hand-edited. Here's how to install the *.ph files:


<P>

<PRE>    1.  become super-user
    2.  cd /usr/include
    3.  h2ph *.h */*.h

If your system supports dynamic loading, for reasons of portability and sanity you probably ought to use h2xs (also part of the standard perl distribution). This tool converts 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> header files to Perl extensions. See
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlxstut.html#">the perlxstut manpage</A> for how to get started with h2xs.

If your system doesn't support dynamic loading, you still probably ought to

You're confusing the purpose of <CODE>system()</CODE> and backticks (``). <CODE>system()</CODE> runs a command and returns exit status information (as a 16 bit value: the low 8 bits are the signal the process died from, if any, and the high 8 bits are the actual exit value). Backticks (``) run a command and return what it sent to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT.</FONT>

<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_capture_STDERR_from_an">How can I capture STDERR from an external command?

There are three basic ways of running external commands:


<P>

<PRE>    system $cmd;                # using system()
    $output = `$cmd`;           # using backticks (``)
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd |&quot;);       # using open()
</PRE>

<P>

With <CODE>system(),</CODE> both 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT</FONT> and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDERR</FONT> will go the same place as the script's versions of these, unless the command redirects them. Backticks and <CODE>open()</CODE> read
 <STRONG>only</STRONG> the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT</FONT> of your command.


<P>

With any of these, you can change file descriptors before the call:


<P>

<PRE>    open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;logfile&quot;);
    system(&quot;ls&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

or you can use Bourne shell file-descriptor redirection:


<P>

<PRE>    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;some_file`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;some_file |&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

You can also use file-descriptor redirection to make 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDERR</FONT> a duplicate of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT:</FONT>



<P>

<PRE>    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 |&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

Note that you <EM>cannot</EM> simply open 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDERR</FONT> to be a dup of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT</FONT> in your Perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection. This doesn't work:



<P>

<PRE>    open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;);
    $alloutput = `cmd args`;  # stderr still escapes
</PRE>

<P>

This fails because the <CODE>open()</CODE> makes 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDERR</FONT> go to where 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT</FONT> was going at the time of the <CODE>open().</CODE> The backticks then make 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT</FONT> go to a string, but don't change 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDERR</FONT> (which still goes to the old 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT).</FONT>



<P>

Note that you <EM>must</EM> use Bourne shell (sh(1)) redirection syntax in backticks, not
<CODE>csh(1)!</CODE> Details on why Perl's <CODE>system()</CODE> and
backtick and pipe opens all use the Bourne shell are in <A

You may also use the IPC::Open3 module (part of the standard perl

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Why_doesn_t_open_return_an_err">Why doesn't open() return an error when a pipe open fails?

</A></H2>
It does, but probably not how you expect it to. On systems that follow the standard <CODE>fork()/exec()</CODE> paradigm (eg, Unix), it works like this: <CODE>open()</CODE> causes a <CODE>fork().</CODE> In the parent, <CODE>open()</CODE> returns with the process 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ID</FONT> of the child. The child <CODE>exec()s</CODE> the command to be piped to/from. The parent can't know whether the <CODE>exec()</CODE> was successful or not - all it can return is whether the <CODE>fork()</CODE> succeeded or not. To find out if the command succeeded, you have to catch 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIGCHLD</FONT> and <CODE>wait()</CODE> to get the exit status. You should also catch 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIGPIPE</FONT> if you're writing to the child -- you may not have found out the <CODE>exec()</CODE> failed by the time you write. This is documented in
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlipc.html#">the perlipc manpage</A>.


<P>

On systems that follow the <CODE>spawn()</CODE> paradigm,
<CODE>open()</CODE> <EM>might</EM> do what you expect - unless perl uses a shell to start your command. In
this case the <CODE>fork()/exec()</CODE> description still applies.

<H2><A NAME="What_s_wrong_with_using_backtick">What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?

</A></H2>
Strictly speaking, nothing. Stylistically speaking, it's not a good way to
write maintainable code because backticks have a (potentially humungous)
return value, and you're ignoring it. It's may also not be very efficient,
because you have to read in all the lines of output, allocate memory for
them, and then throw it away. Too often people are lulled to writing:


<P>

<PRE>    `cp file file.bak`;
</PRE>

<P>

And now they think ``Hey, I'll just always use backticks to run programs.''
Bad idea: backticks are for capturing a program's output; the
<CODE>system()</CODE> function is for running programs.


<P>

Consider this line:


<P>

<PRE>    `cat /etc/termcap`;
</PRE>

<P>

You haven't assigned the output anywhere, so it just wastes memory (for a
little while). Plus you forgot to check <CODE>$?</CODE> to see whether the program even ran correctly. Even if you wrote


<P>

<PRE>    print `cat /etc/termcap`;
</PRE>

<P>

In most cases, this could and probably should be written as


<P>

<PRE>    system(&quot;cat /etc/termcap&quot;) == 0
        or die &quot;cat program failed!&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Which will get the output quickly (as its generated, instead of only at the
end ) and also check the return value.


<P>

<CODE>system()</CODE> also provides direct control over whether shell
wildcard processing may take place, whereas backticks do not.


<P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_call_backticks_without">How can I call backticks without shell processing?

This is a bit tricky. Instead of writing


<P>

You have to do this:


<P>

<PRE>    my @ok = ();
    if (open(GREP, &quot;-|&quot;)) {
        while (&lt;GREP&gt;) {

awkwardness is what would make a shell-&gt;perl converter nigh-on
