<EM>Programming Perl, Second Edition</EM> is a reference work that covers nearly all of Perl, while <EM>Learning Perl, Second Edition</EM> is a tutorial that covers the most frequently used subset of the language.
You might also check out the very handy, inexpensive, and compact
<EM>Perl 5 Desktop Reference</EM>, especially when the thought of lugging the 676-page Camel around doesn't
make much sense.  <EM>Mastering
Regular Expressions</EM>, by Jeffrey Friedl, is a reference work that covers the art and
implementation of regular expressions in various languages including Perl.
