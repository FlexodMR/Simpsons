perlsub - Perl subroutines


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS

</A></H1>
To declare subroutines:


<P>

<PRE>    sub NAME;             # A &quot;forward&quot; declaration.
    sub NAME(PROTO);      #  ditto, but with prototypes
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    sub NAME BLOCK        # A declaration and a definition.
    sub NAME(PROTO) BLOCK #  ditto, but with prototypes
</PRE>

<P>

To define an anonymous subroutine at runtime:


<P>

<PRE>    $subref = sub BLOCK;
</PRE>

<P>

To import subroutines:


<P>

<PRE>    use PACKAGE qw(NAME1 NAME2 NAME3);
</PRE>

<P>

To call subroutines:


<P>

<PRE>    NAME(LIST);    # &amp; is optional with parentheses.
    NAME LIST;     # Parentheses optional if predeclared/imported.
    &amp;NAME;         # Passes current @_ to subroutine.
</PRE>

<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
Like many languages, Perl provides for user-defined subroutines. These may
be located anywhere in the main program, loaded in from other files via the <A HREF="#item_do">do</A>, <A HREF="#item_require">require</A>, or <A HREF="#item_use">use</A> keywords, or even generated on the fly using <A HREF="#item_eval">eval</A> or anonymous subroutines (closures). You can even call a function indirectly using a variable containing its name or a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CODE</FONT> reference to it, as in
 <CODE>$var = \&function</CODE>.


<P>

The Perl model for function call and return values is simple: all functions
are passed as parameters one single flat list of scalars, and all functions
likewise return to their caller one single flat list of scalars. Any arrays
or hashes in these call and return lists will collapse, losing their
identities--but you may always use pass-by-reference instead to avoid this.
Both call and return lists may contain as many or as few scalar elements as
you'd like. (Often a function without an explicit return statement is
called a subroutine, but there's really no difference from the language's
perspective.)


<P>

Any arguments passed to the routine come in as the array @_. Thus if you
called a function with two arguments, those would be stored in <CODE>$_[0]</CODE>
and <CODE>$_[1]</CODE>. The array <CODE>@_</CODE> is a local array, but its elements are aliases
for the actual scalar parameters. In particular, if an element
<CODE>$_[0]</CODE> is updated, the corresponding argument is updated (or an error occurs if it
is not updatable). If an argument is an array or hash element which did not
exist when the function was called, that element is created only when (and
if) it is modified or if a reference to it is taken. (Some earlier versions
of Perl created the element whether or not it was assigned to.) Note that
assigning to the whole array <CODE>@_</CODE> removes the aliasing, and does
not update any arguments.


<P>

The return value of the subroutine is the value of the last expression
evaluated. Alternatively, a return statement may be used to exit the
subroutine, optionally specifying the returned value, which will be
evaluated in the appropriate context (list, scalar, or void) depending on
the context of the subroutine call. If you specify no return value, the
subroutine will return an empty list in a list context, an undefined value
in a scalar context, or nothing in a void context. If you return one or
more arrays and/or hashes, these will be flattened together into one large
indistinguishable list.


<P>

Perl does not have named formal parameters, but in practice all you do is
assign to a <CODE>my()</CODE> list of these. Any variables you use in the
function that aren't declared private are global variables. For the gory
details on creating private variables, see
<A HREF="#Private_Variables_via_my_">Private Variables via my()</A> and <A HREF="#Temporary_Values_via_local_">Temporary Values via local()</A>. To create protected environments for a set of functions in a separate
package (and probably a separate file), see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlmod.html#Packages">Packages</A>.


<P>

Example:


<P>

<PRE>    sub max {
        my $max = shift(@_);
        foreach $foo (@_) {
            $max = $foo if $max &lt; $foo;
        }
        return $max;
    }
    $bestday = max($mon,$tue,$wed,$thu,$fri);
</PRE>

<P>

Example:


<P>

<PRE>    # get a line, combining continuation lines
    #  that start with whitespace
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    sub get_line {
        $thisline = $lookahead;  # GLOBAL VARIABLES!!
        LINE: while (defined($lookahead = &lt;STDIN&gt;)) {
            if ($lookahead =~ /^[ \t]/) {
                $thisline .= $lookahead;
            }
            else {
                last LINE;
            }
        }
        $thisline;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $lookahead = &lt;STDIN&gt;;       # get first line
    while ($_ = get_line()) {
        ...
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Use array assignment to a local list to name your formal arguments:


<P>

<PRE>    sub maybeset {
        my($key, $value) = @_;
        $Foo{$key} = $value unless $Foo{$key};
    }
</PRE>

<P>

This also has the effect of turning call-by-reference into call-by-value,
because the assignment copies the values. Otherwise a function is free to
do in-place modifications of <CODE>@_</CODE> and change its caller's
values.


<P>

<PRE>    upcase_in($v1, $v2);  # this changes $v1 and $v2
    sub upcase_in {
        for (@_) { tr/a-z/A-Z/ }
    }
</PRE>

<P>

You aren't allowed to modify constants in this way, of course. If an
argument were actually literal and you tried to change it, you'd take a
(presumably fatal) exception. For example, this won't work:


<P>

<PRE>    upcase_in(&quot;frederick&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

It would be much safer if the <CODE>upcase_in()</CODE> function were
written to return a copy of its parameters instead of changing them in
place:


<P>

<PRE>    ($v3, $v4) = upcase($v1, $v2);  # this doesn't
    sub upcase {
        return unless defined wantarray;  # void context, do nothing
        my @parms = @_;
        for (@parms) { tr/a-z/A-Z/ }
        return wantarray ? @parms : $parms[0];
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Notice how this (unprototyped) function doesn't care whether it was passed
real scalars or arrays. Perl will see everything as one big long flat
<CODE>@_</CODE> parameter list. This is one of the ways where Perl's simple
argument-passing style shines. The <CODE>upcase()</CODE> function would
work perfectly well without changing the <CODE>upcase()</CODE> definition
even if we fed it things like this:


<P>

<PRE>    @newlist   = upcase(@list1, @list2);
    @newlist   = upcase( split /:/, $var );
</PRE>

<P>

Do not, however, be tempted to do this:


<P>

<PRE>    (@a, @b)   = upcase(@list1, @list2);
</PRE>

<P>

Because like its flat incoming parameter list, the return list is also
flat. So all you have managed to do here is stored everything in <A
HREF="#item__a">@a</A> and made <A HREF="#item__b">@b</A> an empty list.
See <A HREF="#Pass_by_Reference">Pass by Reference</A> for alternatives.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> subroutine may be called using the ``&amp;'' prefix.
The ``&amp;'' is optional in modern Perls, and so are the parentheses if
the subroutine has been predeclared. (Note, however, that the ``&amp;'' is <EM>NOT</EM> optional when you're just naming the subroutine, such as when it's used as
an argument to <CODE>defined()</CODE> or <CODE>undef().</CODE> Nor is it
optional when you want to do an indirect subroutine call with a subroutine
name or reference using the <CODE>&$subref()</CODE> or <CODE>&{$subref}()</CODE> constructs. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlref.html#">the perlref manpage</A>
for more on that.)


<P>

Subroutines may be called recursively. If a subroutine is called using the
``&amp;'' form, the argument list is optional, and if omitted, no
<CODE>@_</CODE> array is set up for the subroutine: the <CODE>@_</CODE>
array at the time of the call is visible to subroutine instead. This is an
efficiency mechanism that new users may wish to avoid.


<P>

<PRE>    &amp;foo(1,2,3);        # pass three arguments
    foo(1,2,3);         # the same
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    foo();              # pass a null list
    &amp;foo();             # the same
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    &amp;foo;               # foo() get current args, like foo(@_) !!
    foo;                # like foo() IFF sub foo predeclared, else &quot;foo&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

Not only does the ``&amp;'' form make the argument list optional, but it
also disables any prototype checking on the arguments you do provide. This
is partly for historical reasons, and partly for having a convenient way to
cheat if you know what you're doing. See the section on Prototypes below.

<H2><A NAME="Private_Variables_via_my_">Private Variables via my()

</A></H2>
Synopsis:


<P>

<PRE>    my $foo;            # declare $foo lexically local
    my (@wid, %get);    # declare list of variables local
    my $foo = &quot;flurp&quot;;  # declare $foo lexical, and init it
    my @oof = @bar;     # declare @oof lexical, and init it
</PRE>

<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> ``my'' declares the listed variables to be confined
(lexically) to the enclosing block, conditional (<CODE>if/unless/elsif/else</CODE>), loop (<CODE>for/foreach/while/until/continue</CODE>), subroutine, <A HREF="#item_eval">eval</A>, or
<CODE>do/require/use</CODE>'d file. If more than one value is listed, the list must be placed in
parentheses. All listed elements must be legal lvalues. Only alphanumeric
identifiers may be lexically scoped--magical builtins like $/ must
currently be localized with ``local'' instead.


<P>

Unlike dynamic variables created by the ``local'' statement, lexical
variables declared with ``my'' are totally hidden from the outside world,
including any called subroutines (even if it's the same subroutine called
from itself or elsewhere--every call gets its own copy).


<P>

(An <CODE>eval(),</CODE> however, can see the lexical variables of the
scope it is being evaluated in so long as the names aren't hidden by
declarations within the <CODE>eval()</CODE> itself. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlref.html#">the perlref manpage</A>.)


<P>

The parameter list to <CODE>my()</CODE> may be assigned to if desired,
which allows you to initialize your variables. (If no initializer is given
for a particular variable, it is created with the undefined value.)
Commonly this is used to name the parameters to a subroutine. Examples:


<P>

<PRE>    $arg = &quot;fred&quot;;        # &quot;global&quot; variable
    $n = cube_root(27);
    print &quot;$arg thinks the root is $n\n&quot;;
 fred thinks the root is 3
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    sub cube_root {
        my $arg = shift;  # name doesn't matter
        $arg **= 1/3;
        return $arg;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

The ``my'' is simply a modifier on something you might assign to. So when
you do assign to the variables in its argument list, the ``my'' doesn't
change whether those variables is viewed as a scalar or an array. So


<P>

<PRE>    my ($foo) = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
    my @FOO = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
</PRE>

<P>

both supply a list context to the right-hand side, while


<P>

<PRE>    my $foo = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
</PRE>

<P>

supplies a scalar context. But the following declares only one variable:


<P>

<PRE>    my $foo, $bar = 1;
</PRE>

<P>

That has the same effect as


<P>

<PRE>    my $foo;
    $bar = 1;
</PRE>

<P>

The declared variable is not introduced (is not visible) until after the
current statement. Thus,


<P>

<PRE>    my $x = $x;
</PRE>

<P>

can be used to initialize the new <A HREF="#item__x">$x</A> with the value
of the old $x, and the expression


<P>

<PRE>    my $x = 123 and $x == 123
</PRE>

<P>

is false unless the old <A HREF="#item__x">$x</A> happened to have the
value 123.


<P>

Lexical scopes of control structures are not bounded precisely by the
braces that delimit their controlled blocks; control expressions are part
of the scope, too. Thus in the loop


<P>

<PRE>    while (defined(my $line = &lt;&gt;)) {
        $line = lc $line;
    } continue {
        print $line;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

the scope of <CODE>$line</CODE> extends from its declaration throughout the
rest of the loop construct (including the <A HREF="#item_continue">continue</A> clause), but not beyond it. Similarly, in the conditional


<P>

<PRE>    if ((my $answer = &lt;STDIN&gt;) =~ /^yes$/i) {
        user_agrees();
    } elsif ($answer =~ /^no$/i) {
        user_disagrees();
    } else {
        chomp $answer;
        die &quot;'$answer' is neither 'yes' nor 'no'&quot;;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

the scope of <CODE>$answer</CODE> extends from its declaration throughout
the rest of the conditional (including <CODE>elsif</CODE> and <CODE>else</CODE> clauses, if any), but not beyond it.


<P>

(None of the foregoing applies to <CODE>if/unless</CODE> or <CODE>while/until</CODE>
modifiers appended to simple statements. Such modifiers are not control
structures and have no effect on scoping.)


<P>

The <CODE>foreach</CODE> loop defaults to scoping its index variable dynamically (in the manner of <A HREF="#item_local">local</A>; see below). However, if the index variable is prefixed with the keyword
``my'', then it is lexically scoped instead. Thus in the loop


<P>

<PRE>    for my $i (1, 2, 3) {
        some_function();
    }
</PRE>

<P>

the scope of <A HREF="#item__i">$i</A> extends to the end of the loop, but
not beyond it, and so the value of <A HREF="#item__i">$i</A> is unavailable
in <CODE>some_function().</CODE>


<P>

Some users may wish to encourage the use of lexically scoped variables. As
an aid to catching implicit references to package variables, if you say


<P>

<PRE>    use strict 'vars';
</PRE>

<P>

then any variable reference from there to the end of the enclosing block must either refer to a lexical variable, or must be fully qualified with the package name. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> compilation error results otherwise. An inner block may countermand this with
 "no&nbsp;strict&nbsp;'vars'".


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> <CODE>my()</CODE> has both a compile-time and a
run-time effect. At compile time, the compiler takes notice of it; the
principle usefulness of this is to quiet <CODE>use strict 'vars'</CODE>. The actual initialization is delayed until run time, so it gets executed
appropriately; every time through a loop, for example.


<P>

Variables declared with ``my'' are not part of any package and are
therefore never fully qualified with the package name. In particular,
you're not allowed to try to make a package variable (or other global)
lexical:


<P>

<PRE>    my $pack::var;      # ERROR!  Illegal syntax
    my $_;              # also illegal (currently)
</PRE>

<P>

In fact, a dynamic variable (also known as package or global variables) are
still accessible using the fully qualified :: notation even while a lexical
of the same name is also visible:


<P>

<PRE>    package main;
    local $x = 10;
    my    $x = 20;
    print &quot;$x and $::x\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

That will print out 20 and 10.


<P>

You may declare ``my'' variables at the outermost scope of a file to hide
any such identifiers totally from the outside world. This is similar to C's
static variables at the file level. To do this with a subroutine requires
the use of a closure (anonymous function). If a block (such as an
<CODE>eval(),</CODE> function, or <A HREF="#item_package">package</A>) wants to create a private subroutine that cannot be called from outside
that block, it can declare a lexical variable containing an anonymous sub
reference:


<P>

<PRE>    my $secret_version = '1.001-beta';
    my $secret_sub = sub { print $secret_version };
    &amp;$secret_sub();
</PRE>

<P>

As long as the reference is never returned by any function within the
module, no outside module can see the subroutine, because its name is not
in any package's symbol table. Remember that it's not <EM>REALLY</EM> called $some_pack::secret_version or anything; it's just $secret_version,
unqualified and unqualifiable.


<P>

This does not work with object methods, however; all object methods have to
be in the symbol table of some package to be found.


<P>

Just because the lexical variable is lexically (also called statically) scoped doesn't mean that within a function it works like a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> static. It normally works more like a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> auto. But here's a mechanism for giving a function private variables with both lexical scoping and a static lifetime. If you do want to create something like C's static variables, just enclose the whole function in an extra block, and put the static variable outside the function but in the block.



<P>

<PRE>    {
        my $secret_val = 0;
        sub gimme_another {
            return ++$secret_val;
        }
    }
    # $secret_val now becomes unreachable by the outside
    # world, but retains its value between calls to gimme_another
</PRE>

<P>

If this function is being sourced in from a separate file via <A HREF="#item_require">require</A> or <A HREF="#item_use">use</A>, then this is probably just fine. If it's all in the main program, you'll need to arrange for the <CODE>my()</CODE> to be executed early, either by putting the whole block above your main program, or more likely, placing merely a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BEGIN</FONT> sub around it to make sure it gets executed before your program starts to run:



<P>

<PRE>    sub BEGIN {
        my $secret_val = 0;
        sub gimme_another {
            return ++$secret_val;
        }
    }
</PRE>

<P>

See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlrun.html#">the perlrun manpage</A> about the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BEGIN</FONT> function.

<H2><A NAME="Temporary_Values_via_local_">Temporary Values via local()

</A></H2>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: In general, you should be using ``my'' instead of ``local'', because it's
faster and safer. Exceptions to this include the global punctuation
variables, filehandles and formats, and direct manipulation of the Perl
symbol table itself. Format variables often use ``local'' though, as do
other variables whose current value must be visible to called subroutines.


<P>

Synopsis:


<P>

<PRE>    local $foo;                 # declare $foo dynamically local
    local (@wid, %get);         # declare list of variables local
    local $foo = &quot;flurp&quot;;       # declare $foo dynamic, and init it
    local @oof = @bar;          # declare @oof dynamic, and init it
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    local *FH;                  # localize $FH, @FH, %FH, &amp;FH  ...
    local *merlyn = *randal;    # now $merlyn is really $randal, plus
                                #     @merlyn is really @randal, etc
    local *merlyn = 'randal';   # SAME THING: promote 'randal' to *randal
    local *merlyn = \$randal;   # just alias $merlyn, not @merlyn etc
</PRE>

<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> <CODE>local()</CODE> modifies its listed variables
to be local to the enclosing block, (or subroutine, <A HREF="#item_eval_">eval{}</A>, or <A HREF="#item_do">do</A>) and <EM>any called from
within that block</EM>. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> <CODE>local()</CODE> just gives temporary values to
global (meaning package) variables. This is known as dynamic scoping.
Lexical scoping is done with ``my'', which works more like C's auto
declarations.


<P>

If more than one variable is given to <CODE>local(),</CODE> they must be
placed in parentheses. All listed elements must be legal lvalues. This
operator works by saving the current values of those variables in its
argument list on a hidden stack and restoring them upon exiting the block,
subroutine, or eval. This means that called subroutines can also reference
the local variable, but not the global one. The argument list may be
assigned to if desired, which allows you to initialize your local
variables. (If no initializer is given for a particular variable, it is
created with an undefined value.) Commonly this is used to name the
parameters to a subroutine. Examples:


<P>

<PRE>    for $i ( 0 .. 9 ) {
        $digits{$i} = $i;
    }
    # assume this function uses global %digits hash
    parse_num();
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # now temporarily add to %digits hash
    if ($base12) {
        # (NOTE: not claiming this is efficient!)
        local %digits  = (%digits, 't' =&gt; 10, 'e' =&gt; 11);
        parse_num();  # parse_num gets this new %digits!
    }
    # old %digits restored here
</PRE>

<P>

Because <CODE>local()</CODE> is a run-time command, it gets executed every
time through a loop. In releases of Perl previous to 5.0, this used more
stack storage each time until the loop was exited. Perl now reclaims the
space each time through, but it's still more efficient to declare your
variables outside the loop.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> local is simply a modifier on an lvalue expression.
When you assign to a localized variable, the local doesn't change whether
its list is viewed as a scalar or an array. So


<P>

<PRE>    local($foo) = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
    local @FOO = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
</PRE>

<P>

both supply a list context to the right-hand side, while


<P>

<PRE>    local $foo = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
</PRE>

<P>

supplies a scalar context.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> note about <A HREF="#item_local">local()</A> and composite types is in order. Something like <A HREF="#item_local">local(%foo)</A> works by temporarily placing a brand new hash in the symbol table. The old
hash is left alone, but is hidden ``behind'' the new one.


<P>

This means the old variable is completely invisible via the symbol table
(i.e. the hash entry in the <CODE>*foo</CODE> typeglob) for the duration of the dynamic scope within which the <A HREF="#item_local">local()</A> was seen. This has the effect of allowing one to temporarily occlude any
magic on composite types. For instance, this will briefly alter a tied hash
to some other implementation:


<P>

<PRE>    tie %ahash, 'APackage';
    [...]
    {
       local %ahash;
       tie %ahash, 'BPackage';
       [..called code will see %ahash tied to 'BPackage'..]
       {
          local %ahash;
          [..%ahash is a normal (untied) hash here..]
       }
    }
    [..%ahash back to its initial tied self again..]

As another example, a custom implementation of <CODE>%ENV</CODE> might look like this:

[Note: The mechanism described in this section was originally the only way
to simulate pass-by-reference in older versions of Perl. While it still
works fine in modern versions, the new reference mechanism is generally
easier to work with. See below.]


<P>

Sometimes you don't want to pass the value of an array to a subroutine but
rather the name of it, so that the subroutine can modify the global copy of
it rather than working with a local copy. In perl you can refer to all
objects of a particular name by prefixing the name with a star: <CODE>*foo</CODE>. This is often known as a ``typeglob'', because the star on the front can
be thought of as a wildcard match for all the funny prefix characters on
variables and subroutines and such.


<P>

When evaluated, the typeglob produces a scalar value that represents all
the objects of that name, including any filehandle, format, or subroutine.
When assigned to, it causes the name mentioned to refer to whatever ``*''
value was assigned to it. Example:


<P>

<PRE>    sub doubleary {
        local(*someary) = @_;
        foreach $elem (@someary) {
            $elem *= 2;
        }
    }
    doubleary(*foo);
    doubleary(*bar);
</PRE>

<P>

Note that scalars are already passed by reference, so you can modify scalar
arguments without using this mechanism by referring explicitly to <CODE>$_[0]</CODE> etc. You can modify all the elements of an array by passing all the
elements as scalars, but you have to use the * mechanism (or the equivalent
reference mechanism) to push, pop, or change the size of an array. It will
certainly be faster to pass the typeglob (or reference).


<P>

Even if you don't want to modify an array, this mechanism is useful for passing multiple arrays in a single 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LIST,</FONT> because normally the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LIST</FONT> mechanism will merge all the array values so that you can't extract out the individual arrays. For more on typeglobs, see

<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perldata.html#Typeglobs_and_Filehandles">Typeglobs and Filehandles</A>.

<H2><A NAME="Pass_by_Reference">Pass by Reference

</A></H2>
If you want to pass more than one array or hash into a function--or return
them from it--and have them maintain their integrity, then you're going to
have to use an explicit pass-by-reference. Before you do that, you need to
understand references as detailed in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlref.html#">the perlref manpage</A>. This section may not make much sense to you otherwise.


<P>

Here are a few simple examples. First, let's pass in several arrays to a
function and have it pop all of then, return a new list of all their former
last elements:


<P>

<PRE>    @tailings = popmany ( \@a, \@b, \@c, \@d );
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    sub popmany {
        my $aref;
        my @retlist = ();
        foreach $aref ( @_ ) {
            push @retlist, pop @$aref;
        }
        return @retlist;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Here's how you might write a function that returns a list of keys occurring
in all the hashes passed to it:


<P>

<PRE>    @common = inter( \%foo, \%bar, \%joe );
    sub inter {
        my ($k, $href, %seen); # locals
        foreach $href (@_) {
            while ( $k = each %$href ) {
                $seen{$k}++;
            }
        }
        return grep { $seen{$_} == @_ } keys %seen;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

So far, we're using just the normal list return mechanism. What happens if
you want to pass or return a hash? Well, if you're using only one of them,
or you don't mind them concatenating, then the normal calling convention is
ok, although a little expensive.


<P>

Where people get into trouble is here:


<P>

<PRE>    (@a, @b) = func(@c, @d);
or
    (%a, %b) = func(%c, %d);
</PRE>

<P>

That syntax simply won't work. It sets just <A HREF="#item__a">@a</A> or <A
HREF="#item__a">%a</A> and clears the <A HREF="#item__b">@b</A> or %b. Plus
the function didn't get passed into two separate arrays or hashes: it got
one long list in @_, as always.


<P>

If you can arrange for everyone to deal with this through references, it's
cleaner code, although not so nice to look at. Here's a function that takes
two array references as arguments, returning the two array elements in
order of how many elements they have in them:


<P>

<PRE>    ($aref, $bref) = func(\@c, \@d);
    print &quot;@$aref has more than @$bref\n&quot;;
    sub func {
        my ($cref, $dref) = @_;
        if (@$cref &gt; @$dref) {
            return ($cref, $dref);
        } else {
            return ($dref, $cref);
        }
    }
</PRE>

<P>

It turns out that you can actually do this also:


<P>

<PRE>    (*a, *b) = func(\@c, \@d);
    print &quot;@a has more than @b\n&quot;;
    sub func {
        local (*c, *d) = @_;
        if (@c &gt; @d) {
            return (\@c, \@d);
        } else {
            return (\@d, \@c);
        }
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Here we're using the typeglobs to do symbol table aliasing. It's a tad
subtle, though, and also won't work if you're using <CODE>my()</CODE>
variables, because only globals (well, and <CODE>local()s)</CODE> are in
the symbol table.


<P>

If you're passing around filehandles, you could usually just use the bare typeglob, like 
<FONT SIZE=-1>*STDOUT,</FONT> but typeglobs references would be better because they'll still work properly under
 <CODE>use strict 'refs'</CODE>. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    splutter(\*STDOUT);
    sub splutter {
        my $fh = shift;
        print $fh &quot;her um well a hmmm\n&quot;;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $rec = get_rec(\*STDIN);
    sub get_rec {
        my $fh = shift;
        return scalar &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Another way to do this is using 
<FONT SIZE=-1>*HANDLE{IO},</FONT> see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlref.html#">the perlref manpage</A> for usage and caveats.


<P>

If you're planning on generating new filehandles, you could do this:


<P>

<PRE>    sub openit {
        my $name = shift;
        local *FH;
        return open (FH, $path) ? *FH : undef;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Although that will actually produce a small memory leak. See the bottom of <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#open_">open()</A> for a somewhat cleaner way using the IO::Handle package.

<H2><A NAME="Prototypes">Prototypes

</A></H2>
As of the 5.002 release of perl, if you declare


<P>

<PRE>    sub mypush (\@@)
</PRE>

<P>

then <CODE>mypush()</CODE> takes arguments exactly like <CODE>push()</CODE>
does. The declaration of the function to be called must be visible at
compile time. The prototype affects only the interpretation of new-style
calls to the function, where new-style is defined as not using the <CODE>&</CODE> character. In other words, if you call it like a builtin function, then it
behaves like a builtin function. If you call it like an old-fashioned
subroutine, then it behaves like an old-fashioned subroutine. It naturally
falls out from this rule that prototypes have no influence on subroutine
references like <CODE>\&foo</CODE> or on indirect subroutine calls like <CODE>&{$subref}</CODE>.


<P>

Method calls are not influenced by prototypes either, because the function
to be called is indeterminate at compile time, because it depends on
inheritance.


<P>

Because the intent is primarily to let you define subroutines that work
like builtin commands, here are the prototypes for some other functions
that parse almost exactly like the corresponding builtins.


<P>

<PRE>    Declared as                 Called as
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    sub mylink ($$)             mylink $old, $new
    sub myvec ($$$)             myvec $var, $offset, 1
    sub myindex ($$;$)          myindex &amp;getstring, &quot;substr&quot;
    sub mysyswrite ($$$;$)      mysyswrite $buf, 0, length($buf) - $off, $off
    sub myreverse (@)           myreverse $a,$b,$c
    sub myjoin ($@)             myjoin &quot;:&quot;,$a,$b,$c
    sub mypop (\@)              mypop @array
    sub mysplice (\@$$@)        mysplice @array,@array,0,@pushme
    sub mykeys (\%)             mykeys %{$hashref}
    sub myopen (*;$)            myopen HANDLE, $name
    sub mypipe (**)             mypipe READHANDLE, WRITEHANDLE
    sub mygrep (&amp;@)             mygrep { /foo/ } $a,$b,$c
    sub myrand ($)              myrand 42
    sub mytime ()               mytime
</PRE>

<P>

Any backslashed prototype character represents an actual argument that
absolutely must start with that character. The value passed to the
subroutine (as part of <CODE>@_</CODE>) will be a reference to the actual argument given in the subroutine call,
obtained by applying
<CODE>\</CODE> to that argument.


<P>

Unbackslashed prototype characters have special meanings. Any unbackslashed @ or % eats all the rest of the arguments, and forces list context. An argument represented by $ forces scalar context. An &amp; requires an anonymous subroutine, which, if passed as the first argument, does not require the ``sub'' keyword or a subsequent comma. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> * does whatever it has to do to turn the argument into a reference to a symbol table entry.



<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> semicolon separates mandatory arguments from
optional arguments. (It is redundant before @ or %.)


<P>

Note how the last three examples above are treated specially by the parser.
<CODE>mygrep()</CODE> is parsed as a true list operator,
<CODE>myrand()</CODE> is parsed as a true unary operator with unary
precedence the same as <CODE>rand(),</CODE> and <CODE>mytime()</CODE> is
truly without arguments, just like <CODE>time().</CODE> That is, if you say


<P>

<PRE>    mytime +2;
</PRE>

<P>

you'll get <CODE>mytime()</CODE> + 2, not <CODE>mytime(2),</CODE> which is
how it would be parsed without the prototype.


<P>

The interesting thing about &amp; is that you can generate new syntax with
it:


<P>

<PRE>    sub try (&amp;@) {
        my($try,$catch) = @_;
        eval { &amp;$try };
        if ($@) {
            local $_ = $@;
            &amp;$catch;
        }
    }
    sub catch (&amp;) { $_[0] }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    try {
        die &quot;phooey&quot;;
    } catch {
        /phooey/ and print &quot;unphooey\n&quot;;
    };
</PRE>

<P>

That prints ``unphooey''. (Yes, there are still unresolved issues having to
do with the visibility of @_. I'm ignoring that question for the moment.
(But note that if we make <CODE>@_</CODE> lexically scoped, those anonymous
subroutines can act like closures... (Gee, is this sounding a little
Lispish? (Never mind.))))


<P>

And here's a reimplementation of grep:


<P>

<PRE>    sub mygrep (&amp;@) {
        my $code = shift;
        my @result;
        foreach $_ (@_) {
            push(@result, $_) if &amp;$code;
        }
        @result;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Some folks would prefer full alphanumeric prototypes. Alphanumerics have
been intentionally left out of prototypes for the express purpose of
someday in the future adding named, formal parameters. The current
mechanism's main goal is to let module writers provide better diagnostics
for module users. Larry feels the notation quite understandable to Perl
programmers, and that it will not intrude greatly upon the meat of the
module, nor make it harder to read. The line noise is visually encapsulated
into a small pill that's easy to swallow.


<P>

It's probably best to prototype new functions, not retrofit prototyping
into older ones. That's because you must be especially careful about silent
impositions of differing list versus scalar contexts. For example, if you
decide that a function should take just one parameter, like this:


<P>

<PRE>    sub func ($) {
        my $n = shift;
        print &quot;you gave me $n\n&quot;;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

and someone has been calling it with an array or expression returning a
list:


<P>

<PRE>    func(@foo);
    func( split /:/ );
</PRE>

<P>

Then you've just supplied an automatic <CODE>scalar()</CODE> in front of
their argument, which can be more than a bit surprising. The old
<CODE>@foo</CODE> which used to hold one thing doesn't get passed in.
Instead, the <CODE>func()</CODE> now gets passed in 1, that is, the number
of elements in @foo. And the <CODE>split()</CODE> gets called in a scalar
context and starts scribbling on your <CODE>@_</CODE> parameter list.


<P>

This is all very powerful, of course, and should be used only in moderation
to make the world a better place.

Functions with a prototype of <CODE>()</CODE> are potential candidates for inlining. If the result after optimization and

has no other references, then it will be used in place of function calls
made without <CODE>&</CODE> or <A HREF="#item_do">do</A>. Calls made using <CODE>&</CODE> or <A HREF="#item_do">do</A> are never inlined. (See constant.pm for an easy way to declare most

If you redefine a subroutine which was eligible for inlining you'll get a
mandatory warning. (You can use this warning to tell whether or not a
particular subroutine is considered constant.) The warning is considered
severe enough not to be optional because previously compiled invocations of
the function will still be using the old value of the function. If you need
to be able to redefine the subroutine you need to ensure that it isn't
inlined, either by dropping the <CODE>()</CODE> prototype (which changes the calling semantics, so beware) or by thwarting
the inlining mechanism in some other way, such as

<H2><A NAME="Overriding_Builtin_Functions">Overriding Builtin Functions

</A></H2>
Many builtin functions may be overridden, though this should be tried only
occasionally and for good reason. Typically this might be done by a package
attempting to emulate missing builtin functionality on a non-Unix system.


<P>

Overriding may be done only by importing the name from a module--ordinary
predeclaration isn't good enough. However, the
<A HREF="#item_subs">subs</A> pragma (compiler directive) lets you, in effect, predeclare subs via the
import syntax, and these names may then override the builtin ones:


<P>

<PRE>    use subs 'chdir', 'chroot', 'chmod', 'chown';
    chdir $somewhere;
    sub chdir { ... }
</PRE>

<P>

Library modules should not in general export builtin names like ``open'' or
``chdir'' as part of their default <CODE>@EXPORT</CODE> list, because these
may sneak into someone else's namespace and change the semantics
unexpectedly. Instead, if the module adds the name to the
<CODE>@EXPORT_OK</CODE> list, then it's possible for a user to import the
name explicitly, but not implicitly. That is, they could say


<P>

<PRE>    use Module 'open';
</PRE>

<P>

and it would import the open override, but if they said


<P>

<PRE>    use Module;

they would get the default imports without the overrides.

<H2><A NAME="Autoloading">Autoloading

</A></H2>
If you call a subroutine that is undefined, you would ordinarily get an
immediate fatal error complaining that the subroutine doesn't exist.
(Likewise for subroutines being used as methods, when the method doesn't
exist in any of the base classes of the class package.) If, however, there
is an <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> subroutine defined in the package or packages that were searched for the
original subroutine, then that
<CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> subroutine is called with the arguments that would have been passed to the
original subroutine. The fully qualified name of the original subroutine
magically appears in the <CODE>$AUTOLOAD</CODE> variable in the same
package as the <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> routine. The name is not passed as an ordinary argument because, er, well,
just because, that's why...


<P>

Most <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> routines will load in a definition for the subroutine in question using
eval, and then execute that subroutine using a special form of ``goto''
that erases the stack frame of the <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> routine without a trace. (See the standard <A HREF="#item_AutoLoader">AutoLoader</A> module, for example.) But an <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> routine can also just emulate the routine and never define it. For example,
let's pretend that a function that wasn't defined should just call
<CODE>system()</CODE> with those arguments. All you'd do is this:


<P>

<PRE>    sub AUTOLOAD {
        my $program = $AUTOLOAD;
        $program =~ s/.*:://;
        system($program, @_);
    }
    date();
    who('am', 'i');
    ls('-l');
</PRE>

<P>

In fact, if you predeclare the functions you want to call that way, you
don't even need the parentheses:


<P>

<PRE>    use subs qw(date who ls);
    date;
    who &quot;am&quot;, &quot;i&quot;;
    ls -l;
</PRE>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> more complete example of this is the standard Shell
