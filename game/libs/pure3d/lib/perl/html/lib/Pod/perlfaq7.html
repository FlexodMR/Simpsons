perlfaq7 - Perl Language Issues ($Revision: 1.18 $, $Date: 1997/04/24
22:44:14 $)


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
This section deals with general Perl language issues that don't clearly fit
into any of the other sections.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Can_I_get_a_BNF_yacc_RE_for_the_">Can I get a BNF/yacc/RE for the Perl language?

</A></H2>
No, in the words of Chaim Frenkel: ``Perl's grammar can not be reduced to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BNF.</FONT> The work of parsing perl is distributed between
yacc, the lexer, smoke and mirrors.''


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_are_all_these_punctuat">What are all these $@%* punctuation signs, and how do I know when to use them?

</A></H2>
They are type specifiers, as detailed in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perldata.html#">the perldata manpage</A>:


<P>

<PRE>    $ for scalar values (number, string or reference)
    @ for arrays
    % for hashes (associative arrays)
    * for all types of that symbol name.  In version 4 you used them like
      pointers, but in modern perls you can just use references.
</PRE>

<P>

While there are a few places where you don't actually need these type
specifiers, you should always use them.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> couple of others that you're likely to encounter
that aren't really type specifiers are:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;&gt; are used for inputting a record from a filehandle.
    \  takes a reference to something.
</PRE>

<P>

Note that &lt;
<FONT SIZE=-1>FILE</FONT>&gt; is <EM>neither</EM> the type specifier for files nor the name of the handle. It is the <CODE>&lt;&gt;</CODE> operator applied to the handle 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FILE.</FONT> It reads one line (well, record - see
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlvar.html#_">$/</A>) from the handle 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FILE</FONT> in scalar context, or <EM>all</EM> lines in list context. When performing open, close, or any other operation
besides <CODE>&lt;&gt;</CODE> on files, or even talking about the handle, do
<EM>not</EM> use the brackets. These are correct: <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_eof">eof(FH)</A>, <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_seek">seek(FH, 0,
2)</A> and ``copying from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDIN</FONT> to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FILE''.</FONT>



<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Do_I_always_never_have_to_quote_">Do I always/never have to quote my strings or use semicolons and commas?

</A></H2>
Normally, a bareword doesn't need to be quoted, but in most cases probably
should be (and must be under <CODE>use strict</CODE>). But a hash key consisting of a simple word (that isn't the name of a
defined subroutine) and the left-hand operand to the <A HREF="#item__gt_">=&gt;</A> operator both count as though they were quoted:


<P>

<PRE>    This                    is like this
    ------------            ---------------
    $foo{line}              $foo{&quot;line&quot;}
    bar =&gt; stuff            &quot;bar&quot; =&gt; stuff
</PRE>

<P>

The final semicolon in a block is optional, as is the final comma in a
list. Good style (see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlstyle.html#">the perlstyle manpage</A>) says to put them in except for one-liners:


<P>

<PRE>    if ($whoops) { exit 1 }
    @nums = (1, 2, 3);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    if ($whoops) {
        exit 1;
    }
    @lines = (
        &quot;There Beren came from mountains cold&quot;,
        &quot;And lost he wandered under leaves&quot;,
    );
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_skip_some_return_values">How do I skip some return values?

</A></H2>
One way is to treat the return values as a list and index into it:


<P>

<PRE>        $dir = (getpwnam($user))[7];
</PRE>

<P>

Another way is to use undef as an element on the left-hand-side:


<P>

<PRE>    ($dev, $ino, undef, undef, $uid, $gid) = stat($file);
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_temporarily_block_warni">How do I temporarily block warnings?

</A></H2>
The <CODE>$^W</CODE> variable (documented in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlvar.html#">the perlvar manpage</A>) controls runtime warnings for a block:


<P>

<PRE>    {
        local $^W = 0;        # temporarily turn off warnings
        $a = $b + $c;         # I know these might be undef
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Note that like all the punctuation variables, you cannot currently use
<CODE>my()</CODE> on <CODE>$^W</CODE>, only <CODE>local().</CODE>


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> new <CODE>use warnings</CODE> pragma is in the works to provide finer control over all this. The curious
should check the perl5-porters mailing list archives for details.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_s_an_extension_">What's an extension?

</A></H2>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> way of calling compiled 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> code from Perl. Reading
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlxstut.html#">the perlxstut manpage</A>
is a good place to learn more about extensions.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Why_do_Perl_operators_have_diffe">Why do Perl operators have different precedence than C operators?

</A></H2>
Actually, they don't. All 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> operators that Perl copies have the same precedence in Perl as they do in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C.</FONT> The problem is with operators that 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> doesn't have, especially functions that give a list context to everything on their right, eg print, chmod, exec, and so on. Such functions are called ``list operators'' and appear as such in the precedence table in

<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlop.html#">the perlop manpage</A>.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> common mistake is to write:


<P>

<PRE>    unlink $file || die &quot;snafu&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

This gets interpreted as:


<P>

<PRE>    unlink ($file || die &quot;snafu&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

To avoid this problem, either put in extra parentheses or use the super low
precedence <CODE>or</CODE> operator:


<P>

<PRE>    (unlink $file) || die &quot;snafu&quot;;
    unlink $file or die &quot;snafu&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

The ``English'' operators (<CODE>and</CODE>, <CODE>or</CODE>, <CODE>xor</CODE>, and <CODE>not</CODE>) deliberately have precedence lower than that of list operators for just
such situations as the one above.


<P>

Another operator with surprising precedence is exponentiation. It binds
more tightly even than unary minus, making <CODE>-2**2</CODE> product a negative not a positive four. It is also right-associating,
meaning that <CODE>2**3**2</CODE> is two raised to the ninth power, not eight squared.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_declare_create_a_struct">How do I declare/create a structure?

</A></H2>
In general, you don't ``declare'' a structure. Just use a (probably
anonymous) hash reference. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlref.html#">the perlref manpage</A> and <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perldsc.html#">the perldsc manpage</A> for details. Here's an example:


<P>

<PRE>    $person = {};                   # new anonymous hash
    $person-&gt;{AGE}  = 24;           # set field AGE to 24
    $person-&gt;{NAME} = &quot;Nat&quot;;        # set field NAME to &quot;Nat&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

If you're looking for something a bit more rigorous, try <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perltoot.html#">the perltoot manpage</A>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_create_a_module_">How do I create a module?

</A></H2>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> module is a package that lives in a file of the same
name. For example, the Hello::There module would live in Hello/There.pm.
For details, read <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlmod.html#">the perlmod manpage</A>. You'll also find <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Exporter.html#">the Exporter manpage</A> helpful. If you're writing a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> or mixed-language module with both 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> and Perl, then you should study
 <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlxstut.html#">the perlxstut manpage</A>.


<P>

Here's a convenient template you might wish you use when starting your own
module. Make sure to change the names appropriately.


<P>

<PRE>    package Some::Module;  # assumes Some/Module.pm
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    use strict;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    BEGIN {
        use Exporter   ();
        use vars       qw($VERSION @ISA @EXPORT @EXPORT_OK %EXPORT_TAGS);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        ## set the version for version checking; uncomment to use
        ## $VERSION     = 1.00;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # if using RCS/CVS, this next line may be preferred,
        # but beware two-digit versions.
        $VERSION = do{my@r=q$Revision: 1.18 $=~/\d+/g;sprintf '%d.'.'%02d'x$#r,@r};
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        @ISA         = qw(Exporter);
        @EXPORT      = qw(&amp;func1 &amp;func2 &amp;func3);
        %EXPORT_TAGS = ( );     # eg: TAG =&gt; [ qw!name1 name2! ],
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # your exported package globals go here,
        # as well as any optionally exported functions
        @EXPORT_OK   = qw($Var1 %Hashit);
    }
    use vars      @EXPORT_OK;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # non-exported package globals go here
    use vars      qw( @more $stuff );
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # initialize package globals, first exported ones
    $Var1   = '';
    %Hashit = ();
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # then the others (which are still accessible as $Some::Module::stuff)
    $stuff  = '';
    @more   = ();
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # all file-scoped lexicals must be created before
    # the functions below that use them.

    my $priv_var    = '';
    my %secret_hash = ();
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # here's a file-private function as a closure,
    # callable as &amp;$priv_func;  it cannot be prototyped.
    my $priv_func = sub {
        # stuff goes here.
    };
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # make all your functions, whether exported or not;
    # remember to put something interesting in the {} stubs
    sub func1      {}    # no prototype
    sub func2()    {}    # proto'd void
    sub func3($$)  {}    # proto'd to 2 scalars

<P>

See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perltoot.html#">the perltoot manpage</A> for an introduction to classes and objects, as well as
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlobj.html#">the perlobj manpage</A> and <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlbot.html#">the perlbot manpage</A>.

<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_tell_if_a_variable_is_">How can I tell if a variable is tainted?

</A></H2>
See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlsec.html#Laundering_and_Detecting_Tainted">Laundering and Detecting Tainted Data</A>. Here's an example (which doesn't use any system calls, because the
<CODE>kill()</CODE> is given no processes to signal):


<P>

<PRE>    sub is_tainted {
        return ! eval { join('',@_), kill 0; 1; };
    }
</PRE>

<P>

This is not <A HREF="#item__w">-w</A> clean, however. There is no <A HREF="#item__w">-w</A> clean way to detect taintedness - take this as a hint that you should
untaint all possibly-tainted data.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_s_a_closure_">What's a closure?

</A></H2>
Closures are documented in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlref.html#">the perlref manpage</A>.


<P>

<EM>Closure</EM> is a computer science term with a precise but hard-to-explain meaning.
Closures are implemented in Perl as anonymous subroutines with lasting
references to lexical variables outside their own scopes. These lexicals
magically refer to the variables that were around when the subroutine was
defined (deep binding).


<P>

Closures make sense in any programming language where you can have the
return value of a function be itself a function, as you can in Perl. Note
that some languages provide anonymous functions but are not capable of
providing proper closures; the Python language, for example. For more
information on closures, check out any textbook on functional programming.
Scheme is a language that not only supports but encourages closures.


<P>

Here's a classic function-generating function:


<P>

<PRE>    sub add_function_generator {
      return sub { shift + shift };
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $add_sub = add_function_generator();
    $sum = &amp;$add_sub(4,5);                # $sum is 9 now.
</PRE>

<P>

The closure works as a <EM>function template</EM> with some customization slots left out to be filled later. The anonymous
subroutine returned by <CODE>add_function_generator()</CODE> isn't
technically a closure because it refers to no lexicals outside its own
scope.


<P>

Contrast this with the following <CODE>make_adder()</CODE> function, in
which the returned anonymous function contains a reference to a lexical
variable outside the scope of that function itself. Such a reference
requires that Perl return a proper closure, thus locking in for all time
the value that the lexical had when the function was created.


<P>

<PRE>    sub make_adder {
        my $addpiece = shift;
        return sub { shift + $addpiece };
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $f1 = make_adder(20);
    $f2 = make_adder(555);
</PRE>

<P>

Now <CODE>&$f1($n)</CODE> is always 20 plus whatever <A HREF="#item__n">$n</A> you pass in, whereas
<CODE>&$f2($n)</CODE> is always 555 plus whatever <A HREF="#item__n">$n</A> you pass in. The
<CODE>$addpiece</CODE> in the closure sticks around.


<P>

Closures are often used for less esoteric purposes. For example, when you
want to pass in a bit of code into a function:


<P>

<PRE>    my $line;
    timeout( 30, sub { $line = &lt;STDIN&gt; } );
</PRE>

<P>

If the code to execute had been passed in as a string, <CODE>'$line =
&lt;STDIN&gt;'</CODE>, there would have been no way for the hypothetical <CODE>timeout()</CODE>
function to access the lexical variable <CODE>$line</CODE> back in its
caller's scope.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_is_variable_suicide_and_how">What is variable suicide and how can I prevent it?

</A></H2>
Variable suicide is when you (temporarily or permanently) lose the value of
a variable. It is caused by scoping through <CODE>my()</CODE> and
<CODE>local()</CODE> interacting with either closures or aliased
<CODE>foreach()</CODE> interator variables and subroutine arguments. It
used to be easy to inadvertently lose a variable's value this way, but now
it's much harder. Take this code:


<P>

<PRE>    my $f = &quot;foo&quot;;
    sub T {
      while ($i++ &lt; 3) { my $f = $f; $f .= &quot;bar&quot;; print $f, &quot;\n&quot; }
    }
    T;
    print &quot;Finally $f\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

The <A HREF="#item__f">$f</A> that has ``bar'' added to it three times
should be a new <A HREF="#item__f">$f</A>
(<CODE>my $f</CODE> should create a new local variable each time through the loop). It isn't,
however. This is a bug, and will be fixed.

<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_pass_return_a_Functio">How can I pass/return a {Function, FileHandle, Array, Hash, Method, Regexp}?

</A></H2>
With the exception of regexps, you need to pass references to these
objects. See <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlsub.html#Pass_by_Reference">Pass by Reference</A> for this particular question, and <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlref.html#">the perlref manpage</A> for information on references.


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Passing">Passing Variables and Functions

</A></STRONG><DD>
Regular variables and functions are quite easy: just pass in a reference to
an existing or anonymous variable or function:


<P>

<PRE>    func( \$some_scalar );
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    func( \$some_array );
    func( [ 1 .. 10 ]   );
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    func( \%some_hash   );
    func( { this =&gt; 10, that =&gt; 20 }   );
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    func( \&amp;some_func   );
    func( sub { $_[0] ** $_[1] }   );
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Passing Filehandles

</A></STRONG><DD>
To create filehandles you can pass to subroutines, you can use <CODE>*FH</CODE>
or <CODE>\*FH</CODE> notation (``typeglobs'' - see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perldata.html#">the perldata manpage</A> for more information), or create filehandles dynamically using the old
FileHandle or the new IO::File modules, both part of the standard Perl
distribution.


<P>

<PRE>    use Fcntl;
    use IO::File;
    my $fh = new IO::File $filename, O_WRONLY|O_APPEND;
                or die &quot;Can't append to $filename: $!&quot;;
    func($fh);
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Passing Regexps

</A></STRONG><DD>
To pass regexps around, you'll need to either use one of the highly experimental regular expression modules from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> (Nick Ing-Simmons's Regexp or Ilya Zakharevich's Devel::Regexp), pass around strings and use an exception-trapping eval, or else be be very, very clever. Here's an example of how to pass in a string to be regexp compared:



<P>

<PRE>    sub compare($$) {
        my ($val1, $regexp) = @_;
        my $retval = eval { $val =~ /$regexp/ };
        die if $@;
        return $retval;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $match = compare(&quot;old McDonald&quot;, q/d.*D/);
</PRE>

<P>

Make sure you never say something like this:


<P>

<PRE>    return eval &quot;\$val =~ /$regexp/&quot;;   # WRONG
</PRE>

<P>

or someone can sneak shell escapes into the regexp due to the double
interpolation of the eval and the double-quoted string. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    $pattern_of_evil = 'danger ${ system(&quot;rm -rf * &amp;&quot;) } danger';
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    eval &quot;\$string =~ /$pattern_of_evil/&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Those preferring to be very, very clever might see the O'Reilly book,

<DT><STRONG>Passing Methods

</A></STRONG><DD>
To pass an object method into a subroutine, you can do this:


<P>

<PRE>    call_a_lot(10, $some_obj, &quot;methname&quot;)
    sub call_a_lot {
        my ($count, $widget, $trick) = @_;
        for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; $count; $i++) {
            $widget-&gt;$trick();
        }
    }
</PRE>

<P>

or you can use a closure to bundle up the object and its method call and
arguments:


<P>

<PRE>    my $whatnot =  sub { $some_obj-&gt;obfuscate(@args) };
    func($whatnot);
    sub func {
        my $code = shift;
        &amp;$code();
    }
</PRE>

<P>

You could also investigate the <CODE>can()</CODE> method in the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIVERSAL</FONT> class (part of the standard perl
distribution).

<H2><A NAME="How_do_I_create_a_static_variabl">How do I create a static variable?

</A></H2>
As with most things in Perl, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>TMTOWTDI.</FONT> What is a ``static variable'' in other
languages could be either a function-private variable (visible only within
a single function, retaining its value between calls to that function), or
a file-private variable (visible only to functions within the file it was
declared in) in Perl.


<P>

Here's code to implement a function-private variable:


<P>

<PRE>    BEGIN {
        my $counter = 42;
        sub prev_counter { return --$counter }
        sub next_counter { return $counter++ }
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Now <CODE>prev_counter()</CODE> and <CODE>next_counter()</CODE> share a
private variable <CODE>$counter</CODE> that was initialized at compile
time.


<P>

To declare a file-private variable, you'll still use a <CODE>my(),</CODE>
putting it at the outer scope level at the top of the file. Assume this is
in file Pax.pm:


<P>

<PRE>    package Pax;
    my $started = scalar(localtime(time()));
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    sub begun { return $started }
</PRE>

<P>

When <CODE>use Pax</CODE> or <CODE>require Pax</CODE> loads this module, the variable will be initialized. It won't get
garbage-collected the way most variables going out of scope do, because the
<CODE>begun()</CODE> function cares about it, but no one else can get it.
It is not called $Pax::started because its scope is unrelated to the
package. It's scoped to the file. You could conceivably have several
packages in that same file all accessing the same private variable, but
another file with the same package couldn't get to it.

<H2><A NAME="What_s_the_difference_between_dy">What's the difference between dynamic and lexical (static) scoping?  Between local() and my()?

</A></H2>
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_local">local($x)</A> saves away the old value of the global variable <A HREF="#item__x">$x</A>, and assigns a new value for the duration of the subroutine, <EM>which is
visible in other functions called from that subroutine</EM>. This is done at run-time, so is called dynamic scoping.
<CODE>local()</CODE> always affects global variables, also called package
variables or dynamic variables.


<P>

<A HREF="#item_my">my($x)</A> creates a new variable that is only visible in the current subroutine. This
is done at compile-time, so is called lexical or static scoping.
<CODE>my()</CODE> always affects private variables, also called lexical
variables or (improperly) <CODE>static(ly</CODE> scoped) variables.


<P>

For instance:


<P>

<PRE>    sub visible {
        print &quot;var has value $var\n&quot;;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    sub dynamic {
        local $var = 'local';   # new temporary value for the still-global
        visible();              #   variable called $var
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    sub lexical {
        my $var = 'private';    # new private variable, $var
        visible();              # (invisible outside of sub scope)
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $var = 'global';
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    visible();                  # prints global
    dynamic();                  # prints local
    lexical();                  # prints global
</PRE>

<P>

Notice how at no point does the value ``private'' get printed. That's
because <CODE>$var</CODE> only has that value within the block of the
<CODE>lexical()</CODE> function, and it is hidden from called subroutine.


<P>

In summary, <CODE>local()</CODE> doesn't make what you think of as private,
local variables. It gives a global variable a temporary value.
<CODE>my()</CODE> is what you're looking for if you want private variables.


<P>

See also <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlsub.html#">the perlsub manpage</A>, which explains this all in more detail.

<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_access_a_dynamic_varia">How can I access a dynamic variable while a similarly named lexical is in scope?

</A></H2>
You can do this via symbolic references, provided you haven't set
<CODE>use strict "refs"</CODE>. So instead of $var, use <CODE>${'var'}</CODE>.


<P>

<PRE>    local $var = &quot;global&quot;;
    my    $var = &quot;lexical&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    print &quot;lexical is $var\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    no strict 'refs';
    print &quot;global  is ${'var'}\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

If you know your package, you can just mention it explicitly, as in
$Some_Pack::var. Note that the notation $::var is <EM>not</EM> the dynamic <CODE>$var</CODE> in the current package, but rather the one in
the <CODE>main</CODE>
package, as though you had written $main::var. Specifying the package
directly makes you hard-code its name, but it executes faster and avoids
running afoul of <CODE>use strict "refs"</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="What_s_the_difference_between_de">What's the difference between deep and shallow binding?

</A></H2>
In deep binding, lexical variables mentioned in anonymous subroutines are
the same ones that were in scope when the subroutine was created. In
shallow binding, they are whichever variables with the same names happen to
be in scope when the subroutine is called. Perl always uses deep binding of
lexical variables (i.e., those created with <CODE>my()).</CODE> However,
dynamic variables (aka global, local, or package variables) are effectively
shallowly bound. Consider this just one more reason not to use them. See
the answer to <A HREF="#What_s_a_closure_">What's a closure?</A>.

</A></H2>
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_local">local()</A> gives list context to the right hand side of <CODE>=</CODE>. The
&lt;
<FONT SIZE=-1>FH</FONT>&gt; read operation, like so many of Perl's functions and operators, can tell
which context it was called in and behaves appropriately. In general, the
<CODE>scalar()</CODE> function can help. This function does nothing to the
data itself (contrary to popular myth) but rather tells its argument to
behave in whatever its scalar fashion is. If that function doesn't have a
defined scalar behavior, this of course doesn't help you (such as with
<CODE>sort()).</CODE>


<P>

To enforce scalar context in this particular case, however, you need merely
omit the parentheses:


<P>

<PRE>    local($foo) = &lt;FILE&gt;;           # WRONG
    local($foo) = scalar(&lt;FILE&gt;);   # ok
    local $foo  = &lt;FILE&gt;;           # right
</PRE>

<P>

You should probably be using lexical variables anyway, although the issue
is the same here:


<P>

<PRE>    my($foo) = &lt;FILE&gt;;  # WRONG
    my $foo  = &lt;FILE&gt;;  # right

If you want to override a predefined function, such as <CODE>open(),</CODE>

<H2><A NAME="What_s_the_difference_between_ca">What's the difference between calling a function as &foo and foo()?

</A></H2>
When you call a function as <CODE>&foo</CODE>, you allow that function access to your current <CODE>@_</CODE> values,
and you by-pass prototypes. That means that the function doesn't get an
empty @_, it gets yours! While not strictly speaking a bug (it's documented
that way in <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlsub.html#">the perlsub manpage</A>), it would be hard to consider this a feature in most cases.


<P>

When you call your function as <CODE>&foo()</CODE>, then you do get a new @_, but prototyping is still circumvented.


<P>

Normally, you want to call a function using <CODE>foo()</CODE>. You may only omit the parentheses if the function is already known to the
compiler because it already saw the definition (<A HREF="#item_use">use</A> but not <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_require">require</A>), or via a forward reference or <CODE>use subs</CODE> declaration. Even in this case, you get a clean <CODE>@_</CODE> without any
of the old values leaking through where they don't belong.

</A></H2>
This is explained in more depth in the <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlsyn.html#">the perlsyn manpage</A>. Briefly, there's no official case statement, because of the variety of
tests possible in Perl (numeric comparison, string comparison, glob
comparison, regexp matching, overloaded comparisons, ...). Larry couldn't
decide how best to do this, so he left it out, even though it's been on the
wish list since perl1.

Some possible reasons: your inheritance is getting confused, you've
misspelled the method name, or the object is of the wrong type. Check out <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perltoot.html#">the perltoot manpage</A> for details on these. You may also use <CODE>print
ref($object)</CODE> to find out the class <CODE>$object</CODE> was blessed into.


<P>

Another possible reason for problems is because you've used the indirect
object syntax (eg, <CODE>find Guru "Samy"</CODE>) on a class name before Perl has seen that such a package exists. It's
wisest to make sure your packages are all defined before you start using
them, which will be taken care of if you use the <A HREF="#item_use">use</A> statement instead of
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_require">require</A>. If not, make sure to use arrow notation (eg,
<CODE>Guru-</CODE><CODE>find(``Samy'')>)</CODE> instead. Object notation is explained in
