<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
This section of the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ</FONT> answers questions about where to find source and
documentation for Perl, support and training, and related matters.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_machines_support_Perl_Wher">What machines support Perl?  Where do I get it?

</A></H2>
The standard release of Perl (the one maintained by the perl development team) is distributed only in source code form. You can find this at <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz,">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz,</A> which is a gzipped archive in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>POSIX</FONT> tar format. This source builds with no porting whatsoever on most Unix systems (Perl's native environment), as well as Plan 9, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VMS,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>QNX,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>OS/2,</FONT> and the Amiga.



<P>

Although it's rumored that the (imminent) 5.004 release may build on Windows 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NT,</FONT> this is yet to be proven. Binary distributions for 32-bit Microsoft systems and for Apple systems can be found <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports/</A> directory. Because these are not part of the standard distribution, they may and in fact do differ from the base Perl port in a variety of ways. You'll have to check their respective release notes to see just what the differences are. These differences can be either positive (e.g. extensions for the features of the particular platform that are not supported in the source release of perl) or negative (e.g. might be based upon a less current source release of perl).



<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> useful 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ</FONT> for Win32 Perl users is <A HREF="http://www.endcontsw.com/people/evangelo/Perl_for_Win32_FAQ.html">http://www.endcontsw.com/people/evangelo/Perl_for_Win32_FAQ.html</A>



<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_can_I_get_a_binary_version_o">How can I get a binary version of Perl?

</A></H2>
If you don't have a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> compiler because for whatever reasons your vendor did not include one with your system, the best thing to do is grab a binary version of gcc from the net and use that to compile perl with. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> only has binaries for systems that are terribly hard to get free compilers for, not for Unix systems.



<P>

Your first stop should be <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports</A> to see what information is already available. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> simple installation guide for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MS-DOS</FONT> is available at <A HREF="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~piet/perl5dos.html">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~piet/perl5dos.html</A> , and similarly for Windows 3.1 at <A HREF="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~piet/perlwin3.html">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~piet/perlwin3.html</A> .



<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="I_don_t_have_a_C_compiler_on_my_">I don't have a C compiler on my system.  How can I compile perl?

</A></H2>
Since you don't have a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> compiler, you're doomed and your vendor should be
sacrificed to the Sun gods. But that doesn't help you.


<P>

What you need to do is get a binary version of gcc for your system first.
Consult the Usenet FAQs for your operating system for information on where
to get such a binary version.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="I_copied_the_Perl_binary_from_on">I copied the Perl binary from one machine to another, but scripts don't work.

</A></H2>
That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ. You
really should build the whole distribution on the machine it will
eventually live on, and then type <CODE>make install</CODE>. Most other approaches are doomed to failure.


<P>

One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print out
the hard-coded <A HREF="#item__INC">@INC</A> which perl is looking for.


<P>

<PRE>        perl -e 'print join(&quot;\n&quot;,@INC)'
</PRE>

<P>

If this command lists any paths which don't exist on your system, then you
may need to move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or create
symlinks, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately.


<P>

You might also want to check out <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfaq8.html#How_do_I_keep_my_own_module_libr">How do I keep my own module/library directory?</A>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="I_grabbed_the_sources_and_tried_">I grabbed the sources and tried to compile but gdbm/dynamic loading/malloc/linking/... failed.  How do I make it work?

</A></H2>
Read the <EM>INSTALL</EM> file, which is part of the source distribution. It describes in detail how
to cope with most idiosyncracies that the Configure script can't work
around for any given system or architecture.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_modules_and_extensions_are_">What modules and extensions are available for Perl?  What is CPAN?  What does CPAN/src/... mean?

</A></H2>

<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a huge archive replicated on dozens of machines all over the world. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> contains source code, non-native ports, documentation, scripts, and many third-party modules and extensions, designed for everything from commercial database interfaces to keyboard/screen control to web walking and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> scripts. The master machine for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> is <A HREF="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/,">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/,</A> but you can use the address <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/CPAN.html">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/CPAN.html</A> to fetch a copy from a ``site near you''. See <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN">http://www.perl.com/CPAN</A> (without a slash at the end) for how this process works.



<P>

CPAN/path/... is a naming convention for files available on 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> sites. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> indicates the base directory of a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> mirror, and the rest of the path is the path from that directory to the file. For instance, if you're using <A HREF="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN</A> as your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> site, the file CPAN/misc/japh file is downloadable as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh</A> .



<P>

Considering that there are hundreds of existing modules in the archive, one probably exists to do nearly anything you can think of. Current categories under CPAN/modules/by-category/ include perl core modules; development support; operating system interfaces; networking, devices, and interprocess communication; data type utilities; database interfaces; user interfaces; interfaces to other languages; filenames, file systems, and file locking; internationalization and locale; world wide web support; server and daemon utilities; archiving and compression; image manipulation; mail and news; control flow utilities; filehandle and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I/O;</FONT> Microsoft Windows modules; and miscellaneous modules.



<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Is_there_an_ISO_or_ANSI_certifie">Is there an ISO or ANSI certified version of Perl?

</A></H2>
Certainly not. Larry expects that he'll be certified before Perl is.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Where_can_I_get_information_on_P">Where can I get information on Perl?

</A></H2>
The complete Perl documentation is available with the perl distribution. If
you have perl installed locally, you probably have the documentation
installed as well: type <CODE>man perl</CODE> if you're on a system resembling Unix. This will lead you to other important man pages. If you're not on a Unix system, access to the documentation will be different; for example, it might be only in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> format. But all proper perl installations have fully-accessible documentation.



<P>

You might also try <CODE>perldoc perl</CODE> in case your system doesn't have a proper man command, or it's been
misinstalled. If that doesn't work, try looking in /usr/local/lib/perl5/pod
for documentation.


<P>

If all else fails, consult the CPAN/doc directory, which contains the
complete documentation in various formats, including native pod, troff,
html, and plain text. There's also a web page at <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com/perl/info/documentation.html">http://www.perl.com/perl/info/documentation.html</A>
that might help.


<P>

It's also worth noting that there's a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PDF</FONT> version of the complete documentation for perl
available in the CPAN/authors/id/BMIDD directory.


<P>

Many good books have been written about Perl -- see the section below for
more details.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What_are_the_Perl_newsgroups_on_">What are the Perl newsgroups on USENET?  Where do I post questions?

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> number books on Perl and/or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> programming are available. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> few of these are good, some are ok, but many aren't worth your money. Tom Christiansen maintains a list of these books, some with extensive reviews, at <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/perl/critiques/index.html.">http://www.perl.com/perl/critiques/index.html.</A>



<P>

The incontestably definitive reference book on Perl, written by the creator
of Perl and his apostles, is now in its second edition and fourth printing.


<P>

<PRE>    Programming Perl (the &quot;Camel Book&quot;):
        Authors: Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Randal Schwartz
        ISBN 1-56592-149-6      (English)
        ISBN 4-89052-384-7      (Japanese)
        (French and German translations in progress)
</PRE>

<P>

Note that O'Reilly books are color-coded: turquoise (some would call it
teal) covers indicate perl5 coverage, while magenta (some would call it
pink) covers indicate perl4 only. Check the cover color before you buy!


<P>

What follows is a list of the books that the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ</FONT> authors found personally useful. Your mileage may
(but, we hope, probably won't) vary.


<P>

If you're already a hard-core systems programmer, then the Camel Book just
might suffice for you to learn Perl from. But if you're not, check out the
``Llama Book''. It currently doesn't cover perl5, but the 2nd edition is
nearly done and should be out by summer 97:


<P>

While some large training companies offer their own courses on Perl, you
may prefer to contact individuals near and dear to the heart of Perl
development. Two well-known members of the Perl development team who offer
such things are Tom Christiansen <A

Randal Schwartz <A

<H2><A NAME="Where_can_I_buy_a_commercial_ver">Where can I buy a commercial version of Perl?

</A></H2>
In a sense, Perl already <EM>is</EM> commercial software: It has a licence that you can grab and carefully read
to your manager. It is distributed in releases and comes in well-defined
packages. There is a very large user community and an extensive literature.
The comp.lang.perl.* newsgroups and several of the mailing lists provide
free answers to your questions in near real-time. Perl has traditionally
been supported by Larry, dozens of software designers and developers, and
thousands of programmers, all working for free to create a useful thing to
make life better for everyone.


<P>

However, these answers may not suffice for managers who require a purchase
order from a company whom they can sue should anything go wrong. Or maybe
they need very serious hand-holding and contractual obligations.
Shrink-wrapped CDs with perl on them are available from several sources if
that will help.


<P>

Or you can purchase a real support contract. Although Cygnus historically
provided this service, they no longer sell support contracts for Perl.
Instead, the Paul Ingram Group will be taking up the slack through The Perl
Clinic. The following is a commercial from them:


<P>

``Do you need professional support for Perl and/or Oraperl? Do you need a
support contract with defined levels of service? Do you want to pay only
for what you need?


<P>

``The Paul Ingram Group has provided quality software development and support services to some of the world's largest corporations for ten years. We are now offering the same quality support services for Perl at The Perl Clinic. This service is led by Tim Bunce, an active perl porter since 1994 and well known as the author and maintainer of the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI,</FONT> DBD::Oracle, and Oraperl modules and author/co-maintainer of The Perl 5 Module List. We also offer Oracle users support for Perl5 Oraperl and related modules (which Oracle is planning to ship as part of Oracle Web Server 3). 20% of the profit from our Perl support work will be donated to The Perl Institute.''

</A></H2>
If you are reporting a bug in the perl interpreter or the modules shipped
with perl, use the perlbug program in the perl distribution or email your
report to <A HREF="MAILTO:perlbug@perl.com.">perlbug@perl.com.</A>


<P>

If you are posting a bug with a non-standard port (see the answer to ``What platforms is Perl available for?''), a binary distribution, or a non-standard module (such as Tk, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI,</FONT> etc), then please see the documentation that came with it to determine the correct place to post bugs.



<P>

Read the perlbug man page (perl5.004 or later) for more information.

<H2><A NAME="What_is_perl_com_perl_org_The_">What is perl.com?  perl.org?  The Perl Institute?

</A></H2>
perl.org is the official vehicle for The Perl Institute. The motto of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>TPI</FONT> is ``helping people help Perl help people'' (or something like that). It's a non-profit organization supporting development, documentation, and dissemination of perl. Current directors of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>TPI</FONT> include Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Randal Schwartz, whom you may have heard of somewhere else around here.



<P>

The perl.com domain is Tom Christiansen's domain. He created it as a public service long before perl.org came about. It's the original 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PBS</FONT> of the Perl world, a clearinghouse for information about all things Perlian, accepting no paid advertisements, glossy gifs, or (gasp!) java applets on its pages.

<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perltoot.html#">the perltoot manpage</A> (distributed with 5.004 or later) is a good place to start.
