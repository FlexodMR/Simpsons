perllocale - Perl locale handling (internationalization and localization)


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
Perl supports language-specific notions of data such as ``is this a
letter'', ``what is the uppercase equivalent of this letter'', and ``which
of these letters comes first''. These are important issues, especially for
languages other than English - but also for English: it would be very na&iuml;ve to think that <CODE>A-Za-z</CODE> defines all the ``letters''. Perl is also aware that some character other
than '.' may be preferred as a decimal point, and that output date
representations may be language-specific. The process of making an
application take account of its users' preferences in such matters is
called <STRONG>internationalization</STRONG>
(often abbreviated as <STRONG>i18n</STRONG>); telling such an application about a particular set of preferences is
known as <STRONG>localization</STRONG> (<STRONG>l10n</STRONG>).


<P>

Perl can understand language-specific data via the standardized 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(ISO</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XPG4,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>POSIX</FONT> 1.c) method called ``the locale system''. The locale system is controlled per application using one pragma, one function call, and several environment variables.



<P>

<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: This feature is new in Perl 5.004, and does not apply unless an
application specifically requests it - see <A HREF="#Backward_compatibility">Backward compatibility</A>. The one exception is that <CODE>write()</CODE> now <STRONG>always</STRONG> uses the current locale - see <A HREF="#NOTES">NOTES</A>.


<P>

<H1><A NAME="PREPARING_TO_USE_LOCALES">PREPARING TO USE LOCALES

</A></H1>
If Perl applications are to be able to understand and present your data
correctly according a locale of your choice, <STRONG>all</STRONG> of the following must be true:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
<STRONG>Your operating system must support the locale system</STRONG>. If it does, you should find that the <CODE>setlocale()</CODE> function is a documented part of its 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> library.



<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
<STRONG>Definitions for the locales which you use must be installed</STRONG>. You, or your system administrator, must make sure that this is the case.
The available locales, the location in which they are kept, and the manner
in which they are installed, vary from system to system. Some systems
provide only a few, hard-wired, locales, and do not allow more to be added;
others allow you to add ``canned'' locales provided by the system supplier;
still others allow you or the system administrator to define and add
arbitrary locales. (You may have to ask your supplier to provide canned
locales which are not delivered with your operating system.) Read your
system documentation for further illumination.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
<STRONG>Perl must believe that the locale system is supported</STRONG>. If it does,
<CODE>perl -V:d_setlocale</CODE> will say that the value for <CODE>d_setlocale</CODE> is
<CODE>define</CODE>.


<P>

</UL>
If you want a Perl application to process and present your data according
to a particular locale, the application code should include the <CODE>use&nbsp;locale</CODE> pragma (see <A HREF="#The_use_locale_pragma">The use locale pragma</A>) where appropriate, and <STRONG>at least one</STRONG> of the following must be true:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
<STRONG>The locale-determining environment variables (see <A HREF="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A>)
must be correctly set up</STRONG>, either by yourself, or by the person who set up your system account, at
the time the application is started.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
<STRONG>The application must set its own locale</STRONG> using the method described in
<A HREF="#The_setlocale_function">The setlocale function</A>.


<P>

</UL>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="USING_LOCALES">USING LOCALES

</A></H1>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="The_use_locale_pragma">The use locale pragma

</A></H2>
By default, Perl ignores the current locale. The <CODE>use&nbsp;locale</CODE>
pragma tells Perl to use the current locale for some operations:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
<STRONG>The comparison operators</STRONG> (<A HREF="#item_lt">lt</A>, <CODE>le</CODE>, <CODE>cmp</CODE>, <CODE>ge</CODE>, and <A HREF="#item_gt">gt</A>) and the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>POSIX</FONT> string collation functions
<CODE>strcoll()</CODE> and <CODE>strxfrm()</CODE> use
<A HREF="#item_LC_COLLATE">LC_COLLATE</A>. <CODE>sort()</CODE> is also affected if it is used without an explicit
comparison function because it uses <CODE>cmp</CODE> by default.


<P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG>  <CODE>eq</CODE> and <CODE>ne</CODE> are unaffected by the locale: they always perform a byte-by-byte comparison
of their scalar operands. What's more, if <CODE>cmp</CODE> finds that its operands are equal according to the collation sequence
specified by the current locale, it goes on to perform a byte-by-byte
comparison, and only returns <EM></EM> (equal) if the operands are bit-for-bit identical. If you really want to
know whether two strings - which <CODE>eq</CODE> and <CODE>cmp</CODE> may consider different - are equal as far as collation in the locale is
concerned, see the discussion in
<A HREF="#Category_LC_COLLATE_Collation">Category LC_COLLATE: Collation</A>.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
<STRONG>Regular expressions and case-modification functions</STRONG> (uc(), <CODE>lc(),</CODE> <CODE>ucfirst(),</CODE> and
<CODE>lcfirst())</CODE> use <A HREF="#item_LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A>




<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
<STRONG>The formatting functions</STRONG> (printf(), <CODE>sprintf()</CODE> and <CODE>write())</CODE> use
<A HREF="#item_LC_NUMERIC">LC_NUMERIC</A>




<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
<STRONG>The POSIX date formatting function</STRONG> (strftime()) uses <A HREF="#item_LC_TIME">LC_TIME</A>.


<P>

</UL>
<A HREF="#item_LC_COLLATE">LC_COLLATE</A>, <A HREF="#item_LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A>, and so on, are discussed further in <A HREF="#LOCALE_CATEGORIES">LOCALE CATEGORIES</A>.


<P>

The default behavior returns with <CODE>no&nbsp;locale</CODE> or on reaching the end of the enclosing block.


<P>

Note that the string result of any operation that uses locale information
is tainted, as it is possible for a locale to be untrustworthy. See <A HREF="#SECURITY">SECURITY</A>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="The_setlocale_function">The setlocale function

</A></H2>
You can switch locales as often as you wish at run time with the
POSIX::setlocale() function:


<P>

<PRE>        # This functionality not usable prior to Perl 5.004
        require 5.004;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # Import locale-handling tool set from POSIX module.
        # This example uses: setlocale -- the function call
        #                    LC_CTYPE -- explained below
        use POSIX qw(locale_h);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # query and save the old locale
        $old_locale = setlocale(LC_CTYPE);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        setlocale(LC_CTYPE, &quot;fr_CA.ISO8859-1&quot;);
        # LC_CTYPE now in locale &quot;French, Canada, codeset ISO 8859-1&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        setlocale(LC_CTYPE, &quot;&quot;);
        # LC_CTYPE now reset to default defined by LC_ALL/LC_CTYPE/LANG
        # environment variables.  See below for documentation.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # restore the old locale
        setlocale(LC_CTYPE, $old_locale);
</PRE>

<P>

The first argument of <CODE>setlocale()</CODE> gives the <STRONG>category</STRONG>, the second the
<STRONG>locale</STRONG>. The category tells in what aspect of data processing you want to apply
locale-specific rules. Category names are discussed in
<A HREF="#LOCALE_CATEGORIES">LOCALE CATEGORIES</A> and <A HREF="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A>. The locale is the name of a collection of customization information
corresponding to a particular combination of language, country or
territory, and codeset. Read on for hints on the naming of locales: not all
systems name locales as in the example.


<P>

If no second argument is provided, the function returns a string naming the
current locale for the category. You can use this value as the second
argument in a subsequent call to <CODE>setlocale().</CODE> If a second
argument is given and it corresponds to a valid locale, the locale for the
category is set to that value, and the function returns the now-current
locale value. You can use this in a subsequent call to
<CODE>setlocale().</CODE> (In some implementations, the return value may
sometimes differ from the value you gave as the second argument - think of
it as an alias for the value that you gave.)


<P>

As the example shows, if the second argument is an empty string, the category's locale is returned to the default specified by the corresponding environment variables. Generally, this results in a return to the default which was in force when Perl started up: changes to the environment made by the application after startup may or may not be noticed, depending on the implementation of your system's 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> library.



<P>

If the second argument does not correspond to a valid locale, the locale
for the category is not changed, and the function returns <EM>undef</EM>.


<P>

For further information about the categories, consult <EM>setlocale(3)</EM>. For the locales available in your system, also consult <EM>setlocale(3)</EM>
and see whether it leads you to the list of the available locales (search
for the <EM>SEE ALSO</EM> section). If that fails, try the following command lines:


<P>

<PRE>        locale -a
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        nlsinfo
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        ls /usr/lib/nls/loc
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        ls /usr/lib/locale
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        ls /usr/lib/nls
</PRE>

<P>

and see whether they list something resembling these


<P>

<PRE>        en_US.ISO8859-1     de_DE.ISO8859-1     ru_RU.ISO8859-5
        en_US               de_DE               ru_RU
        en                  de                  ru
        english             german              russian
        english.iso88591    german.iso88591     russian.iso88595
</PRE>

<P>

Sadly, even though the calling interface for <CODE>setlocale()</CODE> has
been standardized, the names of the locales and the directories where the
configuration is, have not. The basic form of the name is
<EM>language_country/territory</EM><STRONG>.</STRONG><EM>codeset</EM>, but the latter parts are not always present.


<P>

Two special locales are worth particular mention: 
<FONT SIZE=-1>``C''</FONT> and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>``POSIX''.</FONT> Currently these are effectively the same locale: the difference is mainly that the first one is defined by the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> standard and the second by the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>POSIX</FONT> standard. What they define is the
 <STRONG>default locale</STRONG> in which every program starts in the absence of locale information in its environment. (The default default locale, if you will.) Its language is (American) English and its character codeset 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII.</FONT>



<P>

<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Not all systems have the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>``POSIX''</FONT> locale (not all systems are POSIX-conformant), so use 
<FONT SIZE=-1>``C''</FONT> when you need explicitly to specify this default locale.



<P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="The_localeconv_function">The localeconv function

</A></H2>
The POSIX::localeconv() function allows you to get particulars of the
locale-dependent numeric formatting information specified by the current
<A HREF="#item_LC_NUMERIC">LC_NUMERIC</A> and <A HREF="#item_LC_MONETARY">LC_MONETARY</A> locales. (If you just want the name of the current locale for a particular
category, use POSIX::setlocale() with a single parameter - see <A HREF="#The_setlocale_function">The setlocale function</A>.)


<P>

<PRE>        use POSIX qw(locale_h);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # Get a reference to a hash of locale-dependent info
        $locale_values = localeconv();
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # Output sorted list of the values
        for (sort keys %$locale_values) {
            printf &quot;%-20s = %s\n&quot;, $_, $locale_values-&gt;{$_}
        }
</PRE>

<P>

<CODE>localeconv()</CODE> takes no arguments, and returns <STRONG>a reference to</STRONG> a hash. The keys of this hash are formatting variable names such as
<CODE>decimal_point</CODE> and <CODE>thousands_sep</CODE>; the values are the corresponding values. See <EM>POSIX (3)</EM> for a longer example, which lists all the categories an implementation
might be expected to provide; some provide more and others fewer, however.
Note that you don't need <CODE>use
locale</CODE>: as a function with the job of querying the locale,
<CODE>localeconv()</CODE> always observes the current locale.


<P>

Here's a simple-minded example program which rewrites its command line
parameters as integers formatted correctly in the current locale:


<P>

<PRE>        # See comments in previous example
        require 5.004;
        use POSIX qw(locale_h);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # Get some of locale's numeric formatting parameters
        my ($thousands_sep, $grouping) =
             @{localeconv()}{'thousands_sep', 'grouping'};
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # Apply defaults if values are missing
        $thousands_sep = ',' unless $thousands_sep;
        $grouping = 3 unless $grouping;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # Format command line params for current locale
        for (@ARGV) {
            $_ = int;    # Chop non-integer part
            1 while
            s/(\d)(\d{$grouping}($|$thousands_sep))/$1$thousands_sep$2/;
            print &quot;$_&quot;;
        }
        print &quot;\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="LOCALE_CATEGORIES">LOCALE CATEGORIES

</A></H1>
The subsections which follow describe basic locale categories. As well as
these, there are some combination categories which allow the manipulation
of more than one basic category at a time. See
<A HREF="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A> for a discussion of these.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Category_LC_COLLATE_Collation">Category LC_COLLATE: Collation

</A></H2>
When in the scope of <CODE>use&nbsp;locale</CODE>, Perl looks to the <A HREF="#item_LC_COLLATE">LC_COLLATE</A>
environment variable to determine the application's notions on the
collation (ordering) of characters. ('b' follows 'a' in Latin alphabets,
but where do '&aacute;' and '&aring;' belong?)


<P>

Here is a code snippet that will tell you what are the alphanumeric
characters in the current locale, in the locale order:


<P>

<PRE>        use locale;
        print +(sort grep /\w/, map { chr() } 0..255), &quot;\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Compare this with the characters that you see and their order if you state
explicitly that the locale should be ignored:


<P>

<PRE>        no locale;
        print +(sort grep /\w/, map { chr() } 0..255), &quot;\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

This machine-native collation (which is what you get unless <CODE>use
locale</CODE> has appeared earlier in the same block) must be used for sorting raw binary
data, whereas the locale-dependent collation of the first example is useful
for natural text.


<P>

As noted in <A HREF="#USING_LOCALES">USING LOCALES</A>, <CODE>cmp</CODE> compares according to the current collation locale when <CODE>use locale</CODE> is in effect, but falls back to a byte-by-byte comparison for strings which
the locale says are equal. You can use POSIX::strcoll() if you don't want
this fall-back:


<P>

<PRE>        use POSIX qw(strcoll);
        $equal_in_locale =
            !strcoll(&quot;space and case ignored&quot;, &quot;SpaceAndCaseIgnored&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

<CODE>$equal_in_locale</CODE> will be true if the collation locale
specifies a dictionary-like ordering which ignores space characters
completely, and which folds case.


<P>

If you have a single string which you want to check for ``equality in
locale'' against several others, you might think you could gain a little
efficiency by using POSIX::strxfrm() in conjunction with <CODE>eq</CODE>:


<P>

<PRE>        use POSIX qw(strxfrm);
        $xfrm_string = strxfrm(&quot;Mixed-case string&quot;);
        print &quot;locale collation ignores spaces\n&quot;
            if $xfrm_string eq strxfrm(&quot;Mixed-casestring&quot;);
        print &quot;locale collation ignores hyphens\n&quot;
            if $xfrm_string eq strxfrm(&quot;Mixedcase string&quot;);
        print &quot;locale collation ignores case\n&quot;
            if $xfrm_string eq strxfrm(&quot;mixed-case string&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

<CODE>strxfrm()</CODE> takes a string and maps it into a transformed string
for use in byte-by-byte comparisons against other transformed strings
during collation. ``Under the hood'', locale-affected Perl comparison
operators call <CODE>strxfrm()</CODE> for both their operands, then do a
byte-by-byte comparison of the transformed strings. By calling
<CODE>strxfrm()</CODE> explicitly, and using a non locale-affected
comparison, the example attempts to save a couple of transformations. In
fact, it doesn't save anything: Perl magic (see <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlguts.html#Magic_Variables">Magic Variables</A>) creates the transformed version of a string the first time it's needed in
a comparison, then keeps it around in case it's needed again. An example
rewritten the easy way with
<CODE>cmp</CODE> runs just about as fast. It also copes with null characters embedded in
strings; if you call <CODE>strxfrm()</CODE> directly, it treats the first
null it finds as a terminator. And don't expect the transformed strings it
produces to be portable across systems - or even from one revision of your
operating system to the next. In short, don't call <CODE>strxfrm()</CODE>
directly: let Perl do it for you.


<P>

Note: <CODE>use locale</CODE> isn't shown in some of these examples, as it isn't needed:
<CODE>strcoll()</CODE> and <CODE>strxfrm()</CODE> exist only to generate
locale-dependent results, and so always obey the current <A HREF="#item_LC_COLLATE">LC_COLLATE</A> locale.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Category_LC_CTYPE_Character_Typ">Category LC_CTYPE: Character Types

</A></H2>
When in the scope of <CODE>use&nbsp;locale</CODE>, Perl obeys the <A HREF="#item_LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A> locale setting. This controls the application's notion of which characters
are alphabetic. This affects Perl's <A HREF="#item__w">\w</A> regular expression metanotation, which stands for alphanumeric characters -
that is, alphabetic and numeric characters. (Consult <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlre.html#">the perlre manpage</A> for more information about regular expressions.) Thanks to <A HREF="#item_LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A>, depending on your locale setting, characters like '&aelig;', '&eth;', '&szlig;', and '&oslash;' may be understood as <A HREF="#item__w">\w</A> characters.


<P>

The <A HREF="#item_LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A> locale also provides the map used in translating characters between lower
and uppercase. This affects the case-mapping functions - <CODE>lc(),</CODE>
lcfirst, <CODE>uc()</CODE> and <CODE>ucfirst();</CODE> case-mapping
interpolation with <A HREF="#item__l">\l</A>, <A HREF="#item__L">\L</A>, <CODE>\u</CODE> or &lt;
<FONT SIZE=-1>\U&gt;</FONT> in double-quoted strings and in <A HREF="#item_s_">s///</A> substitutions; and case-independent regular expression pattern matching
using the <CODE>i</CODE> modifier.


<P>

Finally, <A HREF="#item_LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A> affects the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>POSIX</FONT> character-class test functions - <CODE>isalpha(),</CODE> <CODE>islower()</CODE> and so on. For example, if you move from the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>``C''</FONT> locale to a 7-bit Scandinavian one, you may find - possibly to your surprise - that ``|'' moves from the <CODE>ispunct()</CODE> class to <CODE>isalpha().</CODE>



<P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> broken or malicious <A HREF="#item_LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A> locale definition may result in clearly ineligible characters being
considered to be alphanumeric by your application. For strict matching of
(unaccented) letters and digits - for example, in command strings -
locale-aware applications should use <A HREF="#item__w">\w</A> inside a <CODE>no locale</CODE> block. See <A HREF="#SECURITY">SECURITY</A>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Category_LC_NUMERIC_Numeric_For">Category LC_NUMERIC: Numeric Formatting

</A></H2>
When in the scope of <CODE>use&nbsp;locale</CODE>, Perl obeys the <A HREF="#item_LC_NUMERIC">LC_NUMERIC</A>
locale information, which controls application's idea of how numbers should
be formatted for human readability by the <CODE>printf(),</CODE>
<CODE>sprintf(),</CODE> and <CODE>write()</CODE> functions. String to
numeric conversion by the POSIX::strtod() function is also affected. In
most implementations the only effect is to change the character used for
the decimal point - perhaps from '.' to ',': these functions aren't aware
of such niceties as thousands separation and so on. (See <A HREF="#The_localeconv_function">The localeconv function</A> if you care about these things.)


<P>

Note that output produced by <CODE>print()</CODE> is <STRONG>never</STRONG> affected by the current locale: it is independent of whether <CODE>use locale</CODE> or <CODE>no
locale</CODE> is in effect, and corresponds to what you'd get from <CODE>printf()</CODE> in the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>``C''</FONT> locale. The same is true for Perl's internal conversions between numeric and string formats:

The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> standard defines the <A HREF="#item_LC_MONETARY">LC_MONETARY</A> category, but no function that is affected by its contents. (Those with
experience of standards committees will recognize that the working group
decided to punt on the issue.) Consequently, Perl takes no notice of it. If
you really want to use <A HREF="#item_LC_MONETARY">LC_MONETARY</A>, you can query its contents - see <A HREF="#The_localeconv_function">The localeconv function</A> - and use the information that it returns in your application's own
formatting of currency amounts. However, you may well find that the
information, though voluminous and complex, does not quite meet your
requirements: currency formatting is a hard nut to crack.

The output produced by POSIX::strftime(), which builds a formatted
human-readable date/time string, is affected by the current <A HREF="#item_LC_TIME">LC_TIME</A>
locale. Thus, in a French locale, the output produced by the <CODE>%B</CODE>
format element (full month name) for the first month of the year would be
``janvier''. Here's how to get a list of the long month names in the
current locale:


<P>

<PRE>        use POSIX qw(strftime);
        for (0..11) {
            $long_month_name[$_] =
                strftime(&quot;%B&quot;, 0, 0, 0, 1, $_, 96);
        }
</PRE>

<P>

Note: <CODE>use locale</CODE> isn't needed in this example: as a function which exists only to generate
locale-dependent results, <CODE>strftime()</CODE> always obeys the current <A HREF="#item_LC_TIME">LC_TIME</A> locale.

While the main discussion of Perl security issues can be found in
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlsec.html#">the perlsec manpage</A>, a discussion of Perl's locale handling would be incomplete if it did not draw your attention to locale-dependent security issues. Locales - particularly on systems which allow unprivileged users to build their own locales - are untrustworthy. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> malicious (or just plain broken) locale can make a locale-aware application give unexpected results. Here are a few possibilities:



<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Regular expression checks for safe file names or mail addresses using
<A HREF="#item__w">\w</A> may be spoofed by an <A HREF="#item_LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A> locale which claims that characters such as ``&gt;'' and ``|'' are alphanumeric.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
String interpolation with case-mapping, as in, say, <CODE>$dest =
"C:\U$name.$ext"</CODE>, may produce dangerous results if a bogus 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LC_CTYPE</FONT> case-mapping table is in effect.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
If the decimal point character in the <A HREF="#item_LC_NUMERIC">LC_NUMERIC</A> locale is surreptitiously changed from a dot to a comma, <A HREF="#item_sprintf">sprintf("%g",
0.123456e3)</A> produces a string result of ``123,456''. Many people would interpret this
as one hundred and twenty-three thousand, four hundred and fifty-six.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> sneaky <A HREF="#item_LC_COLLATE">LC_COLLATE</A> locale could result in the names of students with 
<FONT SIZE=-1>``D''</FONT> grades appearing ahead of those with ``A''s.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
An application which takes the trouble to use the information in
<A HREF="#item_LC_MONETARY">LC_MONETARY</A> may format debits as if they were credits and vice versa if that locale has been subverted. Or it make may make payments in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>US</FONT> dollars instead of Hong Kong dollars.



<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
The date and day names in dates formatted by <CODE>strftime()</CODE> could
be manipulated to advantage by a malicious user able to subvert the
<CODE>LC_DATE</CODE> locale. (``Look - it says

<P>

</UL>
Such dangers are not peculiar to the locale system: any aspect of an
application's environment which may maliciously be modified presents
similar challenges. Similarly, they are not specific to Perl: any
programming language which allows you to write programs which take account
of their environment exposes you to these issues.


<P>

Perl cannot protect you from all of the possibilities shown in the examples
- there is no substitute for your own vigilance - but, when
<CODE>use locale</CODE> is in effect, Perl uses the tainting mechanism (see
<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlsec.html#">the perlsec manpage</A>) to mark string results which become locale-dependent, and which may be
untrustworthy in consequence. Here is a summary of the tainting behavior of
operators and functions which may be affected by the locale:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Comparison">Comparison operators (lt, le, ge, gt and cmp):

</A></STRONG><DD>
Scalar true/false (or less/equal/greater) result is never tainted.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Case">Case-mapping interpolation (with \l, \L, \u or <\U>)

</A></STRONG><DD>
Result string containing interpolated material is tainted if
<CODE>use locale</CODE> is in effect.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Matching">Matching operator (m//):

</A></STRONG><DD>
Scalar true/false result never tainted.


<P>

Subpatterns, either delivered as an array-context result, or as
<CODE>$1</CODE> etc. are tainted if <CODE>use locale</CODE> is in effect, and the subpattern regular expression contains <A HREF="#item__w">\w</A> (to match an alphanumeric character), <CODE>\W</CODE>
(non-alphanumeric character), <A HREF="#item__s">\s</A> (white-space character), or <A HREF="#item__S">\S</A>
(non white-space character). The matched pattern variable, $&amp;, $`
(pre-match), $' (post-match), and $+ (last match) are also tainted if
<CODE>use locale</CODE> is in effect and the regular expression contains <A HREF="#item__w">\w</A>,
<CODE>\W</CODE>, <A HREF="#item__s">\s</A>, or <A HREF="#item__S">\S</A>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Substitution">Substitution operator (s///):

</A></STRONG><DD>
Has the same behavior as the match operator. Also, the left operand of <CODE>=~</CODE> becomes tainted when <CODE>use locale</CODE> in effect, if it is modified as a result of a substitution based on a
regular expression match involving <A HREF="#item__w">\w</A>, <CODE>\W</CODE>, <A HREF="#item__s">\s</A>, or <A HREF="#item__S">\S</A>; or of case-mapping with <A HREF="#item__l">\l</A>, <A HREF="#item__L">\L</A>,<CODE>\u</CODE> or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;\U&gt;.</FONT>


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_In">In-memory formatting function (sprintf()):

</A></STRONG><DD>
Result is tainted if ``use locale'' is in effect.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Output">Output formatting functions (printf() and write()):

</A></STRONG><DD>
Success/failure result is never tainted.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Case-mapping functions (lc(), lcfirst(), uc(), ucfirst()):

</A></STRONG><DD>
Results are tainted if <CODE>use locale</CODE> is in effect.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_POSIX">POSIX locale-dependent functions (localeconv(), strcoll(),
strftime(), strxfrm()):

</A></STRONG><DD>
Results are never tainted.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>POSIX character class tests (isalnum(), isalpha(), isdigit(),
isgraph(), islower(), isprint(), ispunct(), isspace(), isupper(),
isxdigit()):

</A></STRONG><DD>
True/false results are never tainted.


<P>

</DL>
Three examples illustrate locale-dependent tainting. The first program,
which ignores its locale, won't run: a value taken directly from the
command line may not be used to name an output file when taint checks are
enabled.


<P>

<PRE>        #/usr/local/bin/perl -T
        # Run with taint checking
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # Command line sanity check omitted...
        $tainted_output_file = shift;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        open(F, &quot;&gt;$tainted_output_file&quot;)
            or warn &quot;Open of $untainted_output_file failed: $!\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

The program can be made to run by ``laundering'' the tainted value through
a regular expression: the second example - which still ignores locale
information - runs, creating the file named on its command line if it can.


<P>

<PRE>        #/usr/local/bin/perl -T
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        $tainted_output_file = shift;
        $tainted_output_file =~ m%[\w/]+%;
        $untainted_output_file = $&amp;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        open(F, &quot;&gt;$untainted_output_file&quot;)
            or warn &quot;Open of $untainted_output_file failed: $!\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

Compare this with a very similar program which is locale-aware:


<P>

<PRE>        #/usr/local/bin/perl -T
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        $tainted_output_file = shift;
        use locale;
        $tainted_output_file =~ m%[\w/]+%;
        $localized_output_file = $&amp;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        open(F, &quot;&gt;$localized_output_file&quot;)
            or warn &quot;Open of $localized_output_file failed: $!\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

This third program fails to run because $&amp; is tainted: it is the result
of a match involving <A HREF="#item__w">\w</A> when <CODE>use locale</CODE> is in effect.

Versions of Perl prior to 5.004 <STRONG>mostly</STRONG> ignored locale information, generally behaving as if something similar to
the <A HREF="#item__C_">"C"</A> locale (see
<A HREF="#The_setlocale_function">The setlocale function</A>) was always in force, even if the program environment suggested otherwise.
By default, Perl still behaves this way so as to maintain backward
compatibility. If you want a Perl application to pay attention to locale
information, you <STRONG>must</STRONG> use the <CODE>use&nbsp;locale</CODE> pragma (see <A HREF="#The_use_locale_Pragma">The use locale Pragma</A>) to instruct it to do so.

Versions of Perl from 5.002 to 5.003 did use the <A HREF="#item_LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A>
information if that was available, that is, <A HREF="#item__w">\w</A> did understand what are the letters according to the locale environment variables. The problem was that the user had no control over the feature: if the

In versions of Perl prior to 5.004 per-locale collation was possible using
the <CODE>I18N::Collate</CODE> library module. This module is now mildly obsolete and should be avoided in
new applications. The <A HREF="#item_LC_COLLATE">LC_COLLATE</A>
functionality is now integrated into the Perl core language: One can use
locale-specific scalar data completely normally with <CODE>use locale</CODE>, so there is no longer any need to juggle with the scalar references of

<H2><A NAME="Sort_speed_and_memory_use_impact">Sort speed and memory use impacts

Comparing and sorting by locale is usually slower than the default sorting;
slow-downs of two to four times have been observed. It will also consume
more memory: once a Perl scalar variable has participated in any string
comparison or sorting operation obeying the locale collation rules, it will
take 3-15 times more memory than before. (The exact multiplier depends on
the string's contents, the operating system and the locale.) These
downsides are dictated more by the operating system's implementation of the
locale system than by Perl.

Formats are the only part of Perl which unconditionally use information from a program's locale; if a program's environment specifies an
