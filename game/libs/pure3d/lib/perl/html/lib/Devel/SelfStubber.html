Devel::SelfStubber - generate stubs for a SelfLoading module


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS

</A></H1>
To generate just the stubs:


<P>

<PRE>    use Devel::SelfStubber;
    Devel::SelfStubber-&gt;stub('MODULENAME','MY_LIB_DIR');
</PRE>

<P>

or to generate the whole module with stubs inserted correctly


<P>

<PRE>    use Devel::SelfStubber;
    $Devel::SelfStubber::JUST_STUBS=0;
    Devel::SelfStubber-&gt;stub('MODULENAME','MY_LIB_DIR');
</PRE>

<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>MODULENAME</FONT> is the Perl module name, e.g. Devel::SelfStubber, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOT</FONT> 'Devel/SelfStubber' or 'Devel/SelfStubber.pm'.



<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>MY_LIB_DIR</FONT> defaults to '.' if not present.

Devel::SelfStubber prints the stubs you need to put in the module before the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>__DATA__</FONT> token (or you can get it to print the entire module with stubs correctly placed). The stubs ensure that if a method is called, it will get loaded. They are needed specifically for inherited autoloaded methods.



<P>

This is best explained using the following example:


<P>

Assume four classes, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A,B,C</FONT> &amp; 
<FONT SIZE=-1>D.</FONT>



<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> is the root class, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>B</FONT> is a subclass of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> is a subclass of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>B,</FONT> and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>D</FONT> is another subclass of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A.</FONT>



<P>

<PRE>                        A
                       / \
                      B   D
                     /
                    C
</PRE>

<P>

If 
<FONT SIZE=-1>D</FONT> calls an autoloaded method 'foo' which is defined in class 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A,</FONT> then the method is loaded into class 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A,</FONT> then executed. If 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> then calls method 'foo', and that method was reimplemented in class 
<FONT SIZE=-1>B,</FONT> but set to be autoloaded, then the lookup mechanism never gets to the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>AUTOLOAD</FONT> mechanism in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>B</FONT> because it first finds the method already loaded in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A,</FONT> and so erroneously uses that. If the method foo had been stubbed in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>B,</FONT> then the lookup mechanism would have found the stub, and correctly loaded and used the sub from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>B.</FONT>



<P>

So, for classes and subclasses to have inheritance correctly work with
autoloading, you need to ensure stubs are loaded.


<P>

The SelfLoader can load stubs automatically at module initialization with
the statement 'SelfLoader-&gt;<CODE>load_stubs()';,</CODE> but you may wish to avoid having the stub loading overhead associated with your initialization (though note that the SelfLoader::load_stubs method will be called sooner or later - at latest when the first sub is being autoloaded). In this case, you can put the sub stubs before the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>__DATA__</FONT> token. This can be done manually, but this module allows automatic generation of the stubs.



<P>

By default it just prints the stubs, but you can set the global
$Devel::SelfStubber::JUST_STUBS to 0 and it will print out the entire
module with the stubs positioned correctly.


<P>

At the very least, this is useful to see what the SelfLoader thinks are
stubs - in order to ensure future versions of the SelfStubber remain in
step with the SelfLoader, the SelfStubber actually uses the SelfLoader to
determine which stubs are needed.
