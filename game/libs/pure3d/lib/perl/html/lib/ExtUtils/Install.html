Both <CODE>install()</CODE> and <CODE>uninstall()</CODE> are specific to
the way ExtUtils::MakeMaker handles the installation and deinstallation of
perl modules. They are not designed as general purpose tools.


<P>

<CODE>install()</CODE> takes three arguments. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> reference to a hash, a verbose switch and a
don't-really-do-it switch. The hash ref contains a mapping of directories:
each key/value pair is a combination of directories to be copied. Key is a
directory to copy from, value is a directory to copy to. The whole tree
below the ``from'' directory will be copied preserving timestamps and
permissions.


<P>

There are two keys with a special meaning in the hash: ``read'' and
``write''. After the copying is done, install will write the list of target
files to the file named by <CODE>$hashref-&gt;{write}</CODE>. If there is another file named by <CODE>$hashref-&gt;{read}</CODE>, the contents of this file will be merged into the written file. The read and the written file may be identical, but on 
<FONT SIZE=-1>AFS</FONT> it is quite likely, people are installing to a different directory than the one where the files later appear.



<P>

<CODE>install_default()</CODE> takes one or less arguments. If no arguments are specified, it takes 
<FONT SIZE=-1>$ARGV[0]</FONT> as if it was specified as an argument. The argument is the value of MakeMaker's
 <CODE>FULLEXT</CODE> key, like <EM>Tk/Canvas</EM>. This function calls <CODE>install()</CODE> with the same arguments as the
defaults the MakeMaker would use.


<P>

The argumement-less form is convenient for install scripts like


<P>

<PRE>  perl -MExtUtils::Install -e install_default Tk/Canvas
</PRE>

<P>

Assuming this command is executed in a directory with populated <EM>blib</EM> 
directory, it will proceed as if the <EM>blib</EM> was build by MakeMaker on this machine. This is useful for binary
distributions.


<P>

<CODE>uninstall()</CODE> takes as first argument a file containing
filenames to be unlinked. The second argument is a verbose switch, the
third is a no-don't-really-do-it-now switch.


<P>

<CODE>pm_to_blib()</CODE> takes a hashref as the first argument and copies
all keys of the hash to the corresponding values efficiently. Filenames
with the extension pm are autosplit. Second argument is the autosplit
directory.
