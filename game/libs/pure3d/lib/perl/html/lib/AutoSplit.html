AutoSplit - split a package for autoloading

This function will split up your program into files that the AutoLoader
module can handle. It is used by both the standard perl libraries and by
the MakeMaker utility, to automatically configure libraries for
autoloading.


<P>

The <CODE>autosplit</CODE> interface splits the specified file into a hierarchy rooted at the
directory <A HREF="#item__dir">$dir</A>. It creates directories as needed to reflect class hierarchy, and creates
the file <EM>autosplit.ix</EM>. This file acts as both forward declaration of all package routines, and
as timestamp for the last update of the hierarchy.


<P>

The remaining three arguments to <CODE>autosplit</CODE> govern other options to the autosplitter. If the third argument, <EM>$keep</EM>, is false, then any pre-existing
<CODE>*.al</CODE> files in the autoload directory are removed if they are no longer part of
the module (obsoleted functions). The fourth argument, <EM>$check</EM>, instructs <CODE>autosplit</CODE> to check the module currently being split to ensure that it does include a <A HREF="#item_use">use</A> specification for the AutoLoader module, and skips the module if AutoLoader
is not detected. Lastly, the <EM>$modtime</EM>
argument specifies that <CODE>autosplit</CODE> is to check the modification time of the module against that of the <CODE>autosplit.ix</CODE> file, and only split the module if it is newer.


<P>

Typical use of AutoSplit in the perl MakeMaker utility is via the
command-line with:


<P>

<PRE> perl -e 'use AutoSplit; autosplit($ARGV[0], $ARGV[1], 0, 1, 1)'
</PRE>

<P>

Defined as a Make macro, it is invoked with file and directory arguments;
<CODE>autosplit</CODE> will split the specified file into the specified directory and delete
obsolete <CODE>.al</CODE> files, after checking first that the module does use the AutoLoader, and
ensuring that the module is not already currently split in its current form
(the modtime test).


<P>

The <CODE>autosplit_lib_modules</CODE> form is used in the building of perl. It takes as input a list of files
(modules) that are assumed to reside in a directory
<STRONG>lib</STRONG> relative to the current directory. Each file is sent to the autosplitter
one at a time, to be split into the directory <STRONG>lib/auto</STRONG>.


<P>

In both usages of the autosplitter, only subroutines defined following the
perl special marker <EM>__END__</EM> are split out into separate files. Some routines may be placed prior to
this marker to force their immediate loading and parsing.

Currently, <A HREF="#item_AutoSplit">AutoSplit</A> cannot handle multiple package specifications within one file.

<A HREF="#item_AutoSplit">AutoSplit</A> will inform the user if it is necessary to create the top-level directory
specified in the invocation. It is preferred that the script or
installation process that invokes <A HREF="#item_AutoSplit">AutoSplit</A> have created the full directory path ahead of time. This warning may
indicate that the module is being split into an incorrect path.


<P>

<A HREF="#item_AutoSplit">AutoSplit</A> will warn the user of all subroutines whose name causes potential file
naming conflicts on machines with drastically limited (8 characters or
less) file name length. Since the subroutine name is used as the file name,
these warnings can aid in portability to such systems.


<P>

Warnings are issued and the file skipped if <A HREF="#item_AutoSplit">AutoSplit</A> cannot locate either the <EM>__END__</EM> marker or a ``package Name;''-style specification.


<P>

<A HREF="#item_AutoSplit">AutoSplit</A> will also emit general diagnostics for inability to create directories or
files.
