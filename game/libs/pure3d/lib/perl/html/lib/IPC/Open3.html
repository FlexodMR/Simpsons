IPC::Open3, open3 - open a process for reading, writing, and error handling

<PRE>    $pid = open3(\*WTRFH, \*RDRFH, \*ERRFH,
                    'some cmd and args', 'optarg', ...);
</PRE>

Extremely similar to <CODE>open2(),</CODE> <CODE>open3()</CODE> spawns the given <CODE>$cmd</CODE> and connects 
<FONT SIZE=-1>RDRFH</FONT> for reading, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WTRFH</FONT> for writing, and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ERRFH</FONT> for errors. If 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ERRFH</FONT> is '', or the same as 
<FONT SIZE=-1>RDRFH,</FONT> then 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDOUT</FONT> and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>STDERR</FONT> of the child are on the same file handle. The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WTRFH</FONT> will have autoflush turned on.



<P>

If 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WTRFH</FONT> begins with ``&lt;&amp;'', then 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WTRFH</FONT> will be closed in the parent, and the child will read from it directly. If 
<FONT SIZE=-1>RDRFH</FONT> or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ERRFH</FONT> begins with ``
&gt;&amp;'', then the child will send output directly to that file handle. In
both cases, there will be a <CODE>dup(2)</CODE> instead of a
<CODE>pipe(2)</CODE> made.


<P>

If you try to read from the child's stdout writer and their stderr writer,
you'll have problems with blocking, which means you'll want to use
<CODE>select(),</CODE> which means you'll have to use
<CODE>sysread()</CODE> instead of normal stuff.


<P>

<CODE>open3()</CODE> returns the process 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ID</FONT> of the child process. It doesn't return on failure:
it just raises an exception matching <CODE>/^open3:/</CODE>.

It will not create these file handles for you. You have to do this
yourself. So don't pass it empty variables expecting them to get filled in
for you.


<P>

Additionally, this is very dangerous as you may block forever. It assumes
it's going to talk to something like <STRONG>bc</STRONG>, both writing to it and reading from it. This is presumably safe because
you ``know'' that commands like <STRONG>bc</STRONG> will read a line at a time and output a line at a time. Programs like <STRONG>sort</STRONG> that read their entire input stream first, however, are quite apt to cause
deadlock.


<P>

The big problem with this approach is that if you don't have control over
source code being run in the child process, you can't control what it does
with pipe buffering. Thus you can't just open a pipe to
<CODE>cat -v</CODE> and continually read and write a line from it.
