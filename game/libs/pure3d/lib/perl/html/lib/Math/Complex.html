This package lets you create and manipulate complex numbers. By default,
<EM>Perl</EM> limits itself to real numbers, but an extra <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_use">use</A> statement brings full complex support, along with a full set of
mathematical functions typically associated with and/or extended to complex
numbers.


<P>

If you wonder what complex numbers are, they were invented to be able to
solve the following equation:


<P>

<PRE>        x*x = -1
</PRE>

<P>

and by definition, the solution is noted <EM>i</EM> (engineers use <EM>j</EM> instead since
<EM>i</EM> usually denotes an intensity, but the name does not matter). The number
<EM>i</EM> is a pure <EM>imaginary</EM> number.


<P>

The arithmetics with pure imaginary numbers works just like you would
expect it with real numbers... you just have to remember that


<P>

<PRE>        i*i = -1
</PRE>

<P>

so you have:


<P>

<PRE>        5i + 7i = i * (5 + 7) = 12i
        4i - 3i = i * (4 - 3) = i
        4i * 2i = -8
        6i / 2i = 3
        1 / i = -i
</PRE>

<P>

Complex numbers are numbers that have both a real part and an imaginary
part, and are usually noted:


<P>

<PRE>        a + bi
</PRE>

<P>

where <CODE>a</CODE> is the <EM>real</EM> part and <CODE>b</CODE> is the <EM>imaginary</EM> part. The arithmetic with complex numbers is straightforward. You have to
keep track of the real and the imaginary parts, but otherwise the rules
used for real numbers just apply:


<P>

<PRE>        (4 + 3i) + (5 - 2i) = (4 + 5) + i(3 - 2) = 9 + i
        (2 + i) * (4 - i) = 2*4 + 4i -2i -i*i = 8 + 2i + 1 = 9 + 2i
</PRE>

<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> graphical representation of complex numbers is
possible in a plane (also called the <EM>complex plane</EM>, but it's really a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>2D</FONT> plane). The number


<P>

<PRE>        z = a + bi
</PRE>

<P>

is the point whose coordinates are (a, b). Actually, it would be the vector
originating from (0, 0) to (a, b). It follows that the addition of two
complex numbers is a vectorial addition.


<P>

Since there is a bijection between a point in the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>2D</FONT> plane and a complex number (i.e. the mapping is
unique and reciprocal), a complex number can also be uniquely identified
with polar coordinates:


<P>

<PRE>        [rho, theta]
</PRE>

<P>

where <CODE>rho</CODE> is the distance to the origin, and <CODE>theta</CODE> the angle between the vector and the <EM>x</EM> axis. There is a notation for this using the exponential form, which is:


<P>

<PRE>        rho * exp(i * theta)
</PRE>

<P>

where <EM>i</EM> is the famous imaginary number introduced above. Conversion between this
form and the cartesian form <CODE>a + bi</CODE> is immediate:


<P>

<PRE>        a = rho * cos(theta)
        b = rho * sin(theta)
</PRE>

<P>

which is also expressed by this formula:


<P>

<PRE>        z = rho * exp(i * theta) = rho * (cos theta + i * sin theta) 
</PRE>

<P>

In other words, it's the projection of the vector onto the <EM>x</EM> and <EM>y</EM>
axes. Mathematicians call <EM>rho</EM> the <EM>norm</EM> or <EM>modulus</EM> and <EM>theta</EM>
the <EM>argument</EM> of the complex number. The <EM>norm</EM> of <CODE>z</CODE> will be noted <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_abs">abs(z)</A>.


<P>

The polar notation (also known as the trigonometric representation) is much
more handy for performing multiplications and divisions of complex numbers,
whilst the cartesian notation is better suited for additions and
substractions. Real numbers are on the <EM>x</EM>
axis, and therefore <EM>theta</EM> is zero.


<P>

All the common operations that can be performed on a real number have been
defined to work on complex numbers as well, and are merely
<EM>extensions</EM> of the operations defined on real numbers. This means they keep their
natural meaning when there is no imaginary part, provided the number is
within their definition set.


<P>

For instance, the <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sqrt">sqrt</A> routine which computes the square root of its argument is only defined for
positive real numbers and yields a positive real number (it is an
application from <STRONG>R+</STRONG> to <STRONG>R+</STRONG>). If we allow it to return a complex number, then it can be extended to
negative real numbers to become an application from <STRONG>R</STRONG> to <STRONG>C</STRONG> (the set of complex numbers):


<P>

<PRE>        sqrt(x) = x &gt;= 0 ? sqrt(x) : sqrt(-x)*i
</PRE>

<P>

It can also be extended to be an application from <STRONG>C</STRONG> to <STRONG>C</STRONG>, whilst its restriction to <STRONG>R</STRONG> behaves as defined above by using the following definition:


<P>

<PRE>        sqrt(z = [r,t]) = sqrt(r) * exp(i * t/2)
</PRE>

<P>

Indeed, a negative real number can be noted <CODE>[x,pi]</CODE>
(the modulus <EM>x</EM> is always positive, so <CODE>[x,pi]</CODE> is really <CODE>-x</CODE>, a negative number) and the above definition states that


<P>

<PRE>        sqrt([x,pi]) = sqrt(x) * exp(i*pi/2) = [sqrt(x),pi/2] = sqrt(x)*i
</PRE>

<P>

which is exactly what we had defined for negative real numbers above.


<P>

All the common mathematical functions defined on real numbers that are
extended to complex numbers share that same property of working
<EM>as usual</EM> when the imaginary part is zero (otherwise, it would not be called an
extension, would it?).


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> <EM>new</EM> operation possible on a complex number that is the identity for real
numbers is called the <EM>conjugate</EM>, and is noted with an horizontal bar above the number, or <CODE>~z</CODE> here.


<P>

<PRE>         z = a + bi
        ~z = a - bi
</PRE>

<P>

Simple... Now look:


<P>

<PRE>        z * ~z = (a + bi) * (a - bi) = a*a + b*b
</PRE>

<P>

We saw that the norm of <CODE>z</CODE> was noted <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_abs">abs(z)</A> and was defined as the distance to the origin, also known as:


<P>

<PRE>        rho = abs(z) = sqrt(a*a + b*b)
</PRE>

<P>

so


<P>

<PRE>        z * ~z = abs(z) ** 2
</PRE>

<P>

If z is a pure real number (i.e. <CODE>b == 0</CODE>), then the above yields:


<P>

<PRE>        a * a = abs(a) ** 2
</PRE>

<P>

which is true (<A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_abs">abs</A> has the regular meaning for real number, i.e. stands for the absolute
value). This example explains why the norm of <CODE>z</CODE> is noted <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_abs">abs(z)</A>: it extends the <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_abs">abs</A> function to complex numbers, yet is the regular <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_abs">abs</A> we know when the complex number actually has no imaginary part... This
justifies <EM>a posteriori</EM> our use of the <A HREF="/n|/perl/html/./lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_abs">abs</A>
notation for the norm.

the following (overloaded) operations are supported on complex numbers:

The <EM>root</EM> function is available to compute all the <EM>n</EM>
roots of some complex, where <EM>n</EM> is a strictly positive integer. There are exactly <EM>n</EM> such roots, returned as a list. Getting the number mathematicians call <CODE>j</CODE> such that:


<P>

<PRE>        1 + j + j*j = 0;
</PRE>

<P>

is a simple matter of writing:


<P>

<PRE>        $j = ((root(1, 3))[1];
</PRE>

<P>

The <EM>k</EM>th root for <CODE>z = [r,t]</CODE> is given by:


<P>

<PRE>        (root(z, n))[k] = r**(1/n) * exp(i * (t + 2*k*pi)/n)
</PRE>

<P>

The <EM>spaceship</EM> comparison operator, &lt;=&gt;, is also defined. In order to ensure its restriction to real numbers is
conform to what you would expect, the comparison is run on the real part of
the complex number first, and imaginary parts are compared only when the
real parts match.

To create a complex number, use either:


<P>

<PRE>        $z = Math::Complex-&gt;make(3, 4);
        $z = cplx(3, 4);
</PRE>

<P>

if you know the cartesian form of the number, or


<P>

<PRE>        $z = 3 + 4*i;
</PRE>

<P>

if you like. To create a number using the trigonometric form, use either:


<P>

<PRE>        $z = Math::Complex-&gt;emake(5, pi/3);
        $x = cplxe(5, pi/3);
</PRE>

<P>

instead. The first argument is the modulus, the second is the angle (in
radians, the full circle is 2*pi). (Mnmemonic: <CODE>e</CODE> is used as a notation for complex numbers in the trigonometric form).


<P>

It is possible to write:


<P>

<PRE>        $x = cplxe(-3, pi/4);
</PRE>

<P>

but that will be silently converted into <CODE>[3,-3pi/4]</CODE>, since the modulus must be positive (it represents the distance to the
origin in the complex plane).

<H1><A NAME="STRINGIFICATION">STRINGIFICATION

</A></H1>
When printed, a complex number is usually shown under its cartesian form <EM>a+bi</EM>, but there are legitimate cases where the polar format
<EM>[r,t]</EM> is more appropriate.


<P>

By calling the routine <CODE>Math::Complex::display_format</CODE> and supplying either
<CODE>"polar"</CODE> or <CODE>"cartesian"</CODE>, you override the default display format, which is <CODE>"cartesian"</CODE>. Not supplying any argument returns the current setting.


<P>

This default can be overridden on a per-number basis by calling the
<CODE>display_format</CODE> method instead. As before, not supplying any argument returns the current
display format for this number. Otherwise whatever you specify will be the
new display format for <EM>this</EM> particular number.


<P>

For instance:


<P>

<PRE>        use Math::Complex;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        Math::Complex::display_format('polar');
        $j = ((root(1, 3))[1];
        print &quot;j = $j\n&quot;;               # Prints &quot;j = [1,2pi/3]
        $j-&gt;display_format('cartesian');
        print &quot;j = $j\n&quot;;               # Prints &quot;j = -0.5+0.866025403784439i&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

The polar format attempts to emphasize arguments like <EM>k*pi/n</EM>
(where <EM>n</EM> is a positive integer and <EM>k</EM> an integer within [-9,+9]).

<P>

The code is not optimized for speed, although we try to use the cartesian
form for addition-like operators and the trigonometric form for all
multiplication-like operators.


<P>

The <CODE>arg()</CODE> routine does not ensure the angle is within the
range [-pi,+pi] (a side effect caused by multiplication and division using
the trigonometric representation).

All routines expect to be given real or complex numbers. Don't attempt to
