The Carp routines are useful in your own modules because they act like
<CODE>die()</CODE> or <CODE>warn(),</CODE> but report where the error was
in the code they were called from. Thus if you have a routine
<CODE>Foo()</CODE> that has a <CODE>carp()</CODE> in it, then the
<CODE>carp()</CODE> will report the error as occurring where
<CODE>Foo()</CODE> was called, not where <CODE>carp()</CODE> was called.

As a debugging aid, you can force Carp to treat a croak as a confess and a
carp as a cluck across <EM>all</EM> modules. In other words, force a detailed stack trace to be given. This can
be very helpful when trying to understand why, or from where, a warning or
error is being generated.


<P>

This feature is enabled by 'importing' the non-existant symbol 'verbose'.
You would typically enable it by saying


<P>

<PRE>    perl -MCarp=verbose script.pl
</PRE>

<P>

or by including the string <CODE>MCarp=verbose</CODE> in the <EM>PERL5OPT</EM>
environment variable.
