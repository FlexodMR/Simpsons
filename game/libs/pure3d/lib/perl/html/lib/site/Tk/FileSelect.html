FileSelect - a widget for choosing files

<PRE> use Tk::FileSelect;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE> $FSref = $top-&gt;FileSelect(-directory =&gt; $start_dir);
               $top            - a window reference, e.g. MainWindow-&gt;new
               $start_dir      - the starting point for the FileSelect
 $file = $FSref-&gt;Show;
               Executes the fileselector until either a filename is
               accepted or the user hits Cancel. Returns the filename
               or the empty string, respectively, and unmaps the
               FileSelect.
 $FSref-&gt;configure(option =&gt; value[, ...])
               Please see the Populate subroutine as the configuration
               list changes rapidly.

<PRE>   This Module pops up a Fileselector box, with a directory entry on
   top, a list of directories in the current directory, a list of
   files in the current directory, an entry for entering/modifying a
   file name, an accept button and a cancel button.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>   You can enter a starting directory in the directory entry. After
   hitting Return, the listboxes get updated. Double clicking on any
   directory shows you the respective contents. Single clicking on a
   file brings it into the file entry for further consideration,
   double clocking on a file pops down the file selector and calls
   the optional command with the complete path for the selected file.
   Hitting return in the file selector box or pressing the accept
   button will also work. *NOTE* the file selector box will only then
   get destroyed if the file name is not zero length. If you want
   yourself take care of it, change the if(length(.. in sub
   accept_file.

<PRE> 950621 -- The following changes were made:
   1: Rewrote Tk stuff to take advantage of new Compound widget module, so
      FileSelect is now composed of 2 LabEntry and 2 ScrlListbox2 
      subwidgets.
   2: Moved entry labels (from to the left of) to above the entry fields.
   3: Caller is now able to control these aspects of widget, in both
        FileSelect (new) and configure :
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        (Please see subroutine Populate for details, as these options 
         change rapidly!)
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>   4: I changed from Double-Button-1 to Button-1 in the Files listbox,
      to work with multiple mode in addition to browse mode.  I also
      made some name changes (LastPath --&gt; saved_path, ...).
   5: The show method is not yet updated.  
   6: The topLevel stuff is not done yet.  I took it out while I toy with
      the idea of FileSelect as a subwidget.  Then the 'normal' topLevel
      thing with Buttons along the bottom could be build on top of it. 
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE> By request of Henry Katz &lt;katz@fs09.webo.dg.com&gt;, I added the functionality
 of using the Directory entry as a filter. So, if you want to only see the
 *.c files, you add a .c (the *'s already there :) and hit return.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE> 95/10/17, SOL, LUCC.  lusol@Lehigh.EDU 
   
  . Allow either file or directory names to be accepted.
  . Require double click to move into a new directory rather than a single 
    click.  This allows a single click to select a directory name so it can
    be accepted.
  . Add -verify list option so that standard Perl file test operators (like
    -d and -x) can be specified for further name validation.  The default
    value is the special value '!-d' (not a directory), so any name can be
    selected as long as it's not a directory - after all, this IS FileSelect!
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    For example:
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>      $fs-&gt;configure(-verify =&gt; ['-d', [\&amp;verify_code, $P1, $P2, ... $Pn]]);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    ensures that the selected name is a directory.  Further, if an element of
    the list is an array reference, the first element is a code reference to a
    subroutine and the remaining optional elements are it's parameters.  The
    subroutine is called like this:
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>      &amp;verify_code($cd, $leaf, $P1, $P2, ... $Pn);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    where $cd is the current directory, $leaf is a directory or file name, and
    $P1 .. $Pn are your optional parameters.  The subroutine should return TRUE
    if success or FALSE if failure.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE> 961008 -- derf@ti.com :
   By request of Jim Stern &lt;js@world.northgrum.com&gt; and Brad Vance
   &lt;bvance@ti.com&gt;, I updated the Accept and Show functions to support 
   selection of multiple files.  I also corrected a typo in the -verify code.
