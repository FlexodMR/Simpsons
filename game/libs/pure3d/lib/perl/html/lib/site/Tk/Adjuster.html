Tk::Adjuster, packAdjust - Allow size of packed widgets to be adjusted by

<CODE>packAdjust</CODE> calls pack on the widget and then creates an instance of Tk::Adjuster and
packs that ``after'' the widget. Tk::Adjust is a Frame containing a
``line'' and a blob. 


<P>

Dragging either with Mouse Button-1 results in a line being dragged to
indicate new size. Releasing Button submits GeometryRequests on behalf of
the widget which will cause the packer to change widget's size. 


<P>

If Drag is done with Shift button down, then GeometryRequests are made in
``real time'' so that text-flow effects can be seen, but as a lot more work
is done behaviour may be sluggish.


<P>

If widget is packed with -side =&gt; left or -side =&gt; right then width
is adjusted. If packed -side =&gt; top or -side =&gt; bottom then height is
adjusted.


<P>

<CODE>packPropagate</CODE> is turned off for the master window to prevent adjustment changing overall
window size. Similarly <CODE>packPropagate</CODE> is turned off for the managed widget if it has things packed inside it.
This is so that the GeometryRequests that Tk::Adjuster are not overriden by
pack.

The 'line' which is used to feedback position is in fact a 'Menu' widget
set to an unorthodox shape, and with a black background.

If the size of adjustable widget is increased to the limit there is no
longer room for the Tk::Ajuster widget. As a work-round it forcibly makes
room for itself if it is unmapped. However the ``grab'' it held will have
been lost and button-motion events may be sent to other widgets which are
not expecting them, which can result in error messages.
