To quote Tim Bunce, the architect and author of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI:</FONT>


<P>

<PRE>    ``DBI is a database access Application Programming Interface (API)
      for the Perl Language. The DBI API Specification defines a set
      of functions, variables and conventions that provide a consistent
      database interface independant of the actual database being used.''
</PRE>

<P>

In simple language, the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> interface allows users to access multiple database types transparently. So, if you connecting to an Oracle, Informix, mSQL, Sybase or whatever database, you don't need to know the underlying mechanics of the interface. The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>API</FONT> defined by 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> will work on
 <EM>all</EM> these database types.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> similar benefit is gained by the ability to connect
to two <EM>different</EM>
databases of different vendor within the one perl script, <EM>ie</EM>, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> want to read data from an Oracle database and insert it back into an Informix database all within one program. The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> layer allows you to do this simply and powerfully.



<P>

Here's a diagram that demonstrates the principle:

<EM>DBperl</EM> is the old name for the interface specification. It's usually now used to
denote perl<EM>4</EM> modules on database interfacing, such as,
<EM>oraperl</EM>, <EM>isqlperl</EM>, <EM>ingperl</EM> and so on. These interfaces didn't have a standard 
<FONT SIZE=-1>API</FONT> and are generally <EM>not</EM> supported.


<P>

Here's a list of old DBperl's, their corresponding 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> counterparts and support information. <EM>Please note</EM>, the author's listed here generally
<EM>do not</EM> maintain the

<P>

However, some 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> modules have DBperl emulation layers, so, <EM>DBD::Oracle</EM>
for example comes with an Oraperl emulation layer, which allows you to run legacy oraperl scripts without modification. The emulation layer translates the oraperl 
<FONT SIZE=-1>API</FONT> calls into the corresponding 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> calls.



<P>

Here's a table of emulation layer information:


<P>

<PRE>    Module          Emulation Layer     Status
    ------          ---------------     ------
    DBD::Oracle     Oraperl             Complete
    DBD::Ingres     Ingperl             Complete
    DBD::Informix   Isqlperl            Under development
    DBD::Sybase     Sybperl             Working? ( Needs verification )
    DBD::mSQL       Msqlperl            Experimentally released with 
                                        DBD::mSQL-0.61
</PRE>

<P>

The <EM>Msqlperl</EM> emulation is a special case. <EM>Msqlperl</EM> is a perl5 driver for <EM>mSQL</EM> databases, but does not conform to the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> Specification. It's use is being deprecated in
favour of <EM>DBD::mSQL</EM>. <EM>Msqlperl</EM> may be downloaded from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> <EM>via</EM>:

</PRE>

<P>

There are two specifications available at this link, the new 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> Draft Specification which is a rapidly evolving document as Tim Bunce and the development team drive towards a stable interface, and the old historical DBperl Specification out of which the current 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> interface evolved.



<P>

The latter document should be regarded as being of historical interest only
and should not serve as a programming manual, or authoratative in any
sense. However, it is still a very useful reference source.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_POD">POD documentation

</A></STRONG><DD>
<EM>POD</EM>s are chunks of documentation usually embedded within perl programs that
document the code ``<EM>in place</EM>'', providing a useful resource for programmers and users of modules. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>POD</FONT> for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> and drivers is beginning to become more commonplace, and documentation for these modules can be read with the following commands.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_The">The DBI Specification

The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>POD</FONT> for the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> Specification can be read with the:

This document, the <EM>Frequently Asked Questions</EM> is also available as

system by typing:

This may be more convenient to persons not permanently, or conveniently,
connected to the Internet but the document may not be the latest version.

Users of the Oraperl emulation layer bundled with <EM>DBD::Oracle</EM>, may read up on how to program with the Oraperl interface by typing:

This will produce an updated copy of the original oraperl man page written by Kevin Stock for perl4. The oraperl 
<FONT SIZE=-1>API</FONT> is fully listed and described there.

Users with the Tk module installed may be interested to learn there is a Tk-based

There are a series of occasional rambles from various people on the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> mailing lists who, in an attempt to clear up a
simple point, end up drafting fairly comprehensive documents. These are
quite often varying in quality, but do provide some insights into the
workings of the interfaces.

</A></STRONG><DD>
This article, published in the November 1996 edition of ``Dr. Dobbs
Journal'' concerned <EM>DBperl</EM>. The author of this edition apparently did not bother to contact any of the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> development team members for verification of the information contained within his article. Several reviews of the article on the
 <EM>dbi-users</EM> mailing list were disparaging, to say the least. The fact the article was
written about <EM>DBperl</EM> instead of <EM>DBI</EM> hints at the staleness of the information. However, we include the
reference for completeness' sake.

Extracted from ``<EM>DBI - The Database Interface for Perl 5</EM>'':


<P>

<PRE>    ``UNIX was originally blessed with simple file-based ``databases'', namely
    the dbm system. dbm lets you store data in files, and retrieve
    that data quickly. However, it also has serious drawbacks.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        File Locking
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        The dbm systems did not allow particularly robust file locking
        capabilities, nor any capability for correcting problems arising through
        simultaneous writes [ to the database ].
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        Arbitrary Data Structures
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        The dbm systems only allows a single fixed data structure:
        key-value pairs. That value could be a complex object, such as a
        [ C ] struct, but the key had to be unique. This was a large
        limitation on the usefulness of dbm systems.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    However, dbm systems still provide a useful function for users with
    simple datasets and limited resources, since they are fast, robust and 
    extremely well-tested. Perl modules to access dbm systems have now
    been integrated into the core Perl distribution via the
    AnyDBM_File module.''
</PRE>

<P>

To sum up, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBM</FONT> is a perfectly satisfactory solution for
essentially read-only databases, or small and simple datasets with a single
user. However, for more powerful and scaleable datasets, not to mention
robust transactional locking, users are recommended to use <EM>DBI</EM>.

Basically, a good chance this is occurring is due to the fact that the user
that you ran it from the command line as has a correctly configured set of
environment variables, in the case of <EM>DBD::Oracle</EM>, variables like
<CODE>$ORACLE_HOME</CODE>, <CODE>$ORACLE_SID</CODE> or <CODE>TWO_TASK</CODE>.


<P>

The <CODE>httpd</CODE> process usually runs under the user id of <CODE>nobody</CODE>, which implies there is no configured environment. Any scripts attempting
to execute in this situation will correctly fail.


<P>

To solve this problem, set the environment for your database in a <A HREF="#item_BEGIN_">BEGIN { }</A>
block at the top of your script. This will generally solve the problem.

Similarly, you should check your <CODE>httpd</CODE> error logfile for any clues, as well as the very valuable ``Idiot's Guide To Solving Perl /
