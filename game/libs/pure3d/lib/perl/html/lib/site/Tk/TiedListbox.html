TiedListbox causes two or more Listboxes to be operated in tandem. One
application is emulating multi-column listboxes. The scrolling, selection,
or both mechanisms may be tied together. The methods <STRONG>tie</STRONG>
and <STRONG>untie</STRONG> are provided, along with overridden versions of some of the Listbox methods
to provide tandem operation.


<P>

Scrollbars are fully supported. You can use either explicitly created
<STRONG>Scrollbar</STRONG>s, the <STRONG>ScrlListbox</STRONG> widget, or the <STRONG>Scrolled</STRONG>
super-widget. Tricks to ``attach'' multiple tied listboxes to a single
scrollbar are unnecessary and will lead to multiple calls of the listbox
methods (a bad thing).


<P>

The configuration options, geometry, and items of the Listboxes are not
altered by tying them. The programmer will have to make sure that the setup
of the Listboxes make sense together. Here are some (unenforced)
guidelines:


<P>

For listboxes with tied selection: set <STRONG>-exportselection</STRONG> to 0 for all but possibly one Listbox use identical <STRONG>-selectmode</STRONG> for all Listboxes if items are added/deleted, they should be done all at
once and at the same index, or the selection should be cleared Listboxes
should have the same number of items For listboxes with tied scrolling: use
the same window height and font for all Listboxes Listboxes should have the
same number of items

</A></STRONG><DD>
Ties together <EM>$listbox</EM> and the list of Listboxes with the given
<EM>option</EM>. Returns <EM>$listbox</EM>.


<P>

If no arguments are given, returns a list containing two items: the tie
option (``scroll'', ``selection'', or ``all'') and the list of Listboxes
that <EM>$listbox</EM> is tied to.


<P>

<EM>option</EM> can be one of ``scroll'', ``selection'', or ``all''. If omitted, ``all'' is
assumed. ``scroll'' makes the tied Listboxes to scroll together,
``selection'' makes selections to occur simultaneously in all tied
Listboxes, and ``all'' effects both actions.


<P>

All the Listboxes are <STRONG>untie</STRONG>d (if previously tied) before being tied to each other; hence a Listbox can
only be in one ``tie group'' at a time. ``Tiedness'' is commutative.


<P>

The tie method can be called with either Listbox or TiedListbox objects.
All listbox objects specified are reblessed to TiedListbox objects.


<P>

Code such as below can be used to tie ScrlListboxes:


<P>

<PRE>  $slb1=ScrlListbox(...); # or Scrolled('Listbox',...
  $slb2=ScrlListbox(...); # or Scrolled('Listbox',...
  $slb1-&gt;tie([$slb2-&gt;Subwidget('scrolled')]);
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__listbox_untie_">$listbox->untie()

</A></STRONG><DD>
This function unties the Listbox from its ``tie group''. The other items in
the ``tie group'' (if more than one) remain tied to each other.


<P>

Returns a list containing two items: the old tie option (``scroll'',
``selection'', or ``all'') and the list of Listboxes that <EM>$listbox</EM> was tied to.


<P>

<H1><A NAME="OVERRIDDEN_METHODS">OVERRIDDEN METHODS

</A></H1>
You probably don't care about these. They are just details to tie together
the behaviors of the listboxes.


<P>

All overriden methods take identical arguments as the corresponding
<STRONG>Listbox</STRONG> methods (see the <STRONG>Listbox</STRONG> documentation for a full description). All overridden methods that take an
index interpret that index in the context of the listbox object provided.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__listbox_activate_">$listbox->activate(...)
=item $listbox->selection(...)

</A></STRONG><DD>
To allow tied selection, these functions are overridden for listboxes tied
together with the ``selection'' or ``all'' option. When an item is selected
or activated in one listbox, the items with the same index (if present) are
selected or activated in all tied listboxes.


<P>

The <STRONG>selection</STRONG>('includes',...) submethod returns only information about the given <EM>$listbox</EM>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__listbox_scan_">$listbox->scan(...)
=item $listbox->see(...)
=item $listbox->yview(...)

</A></STRONG><DD>
To allow tied scrolling, these functions are overridden for listboxes tied
together with the ``scroll'' or ``all'' option. When one listbox is
scrolled, all the other tied listboxes are scrolled by the same number of
items (if possible). An attempt is made to keep items of the same index at
the top of each tied listbox, while not interfering with the normal
scrolling operations.


<P>

The <STRONG>yview</STRONG> method with no arguments returns only information about the given <EM>$listbox</EM>.


<P>

Horizontal scrolling (via <STRONG>xview</STRONG>) is not tied.

</A></H1>
Reblessing the widgets to TiedListbox might be too weird. It will disable any additional features for widgets in a class derived from Listbox (none yet that 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> know of).



<P>

The bindtags for reblessed widgets aren't updated. This is probably
wouldn't be a good thing to do automatically anyway.
