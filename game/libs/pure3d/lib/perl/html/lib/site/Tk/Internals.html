CallingTk - what is Perl Tk interface doing when you call Tk functions.


<P>

This information is worse than useless for <CODE>perlTk</CODE> users, but can of some help for people interested in using modified Tk
source with
<CODE>perlTk</CODE>.


<P>

<EM>This document is under construction. The information is believed to
be pertinent to the version of</EM>  <CODE>portableTk</CODE>  <EM>available when it was
created. All the details are subject to change.</EM>

Before the actual compilation stage a script scans the source and extracts
the subcommands of different commands. This information resides in the file <CODE>pTk/Methods.def</CODE>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Compilation">Compilation

</A></STRONG><DD>
During compilation the above file is included in the source of booting
routine of dynamic (or static) library. More precisely, the booting code of
module <CODE>Tk</CODE> calls the subroutine <CODE>Boot_Glue()</CODE> from the module
<CODE>tkGlue.c</CODE>, and this subroutine includes the file (with appropriate macro
definitions).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Inside">Inside use Tk;

</A></STRONG><DD>
The module bootstraps the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> code, then loads the Perl libraries. The heart of
the Perl code is contained in the <CODE>Tk::Widget</CODE> library, all the widgets inherit from this module. Code for toplevels is
loaded from
<CODE>Tk::MainWindow</CODE>. 


<P>

During bootstrap of the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> glue code the <CODE>Xevent::?</CODE> codes and a handful of <CODE>Tk::Widget</CODE> and <CODE>Tk::Image</CODE> routines are defined. (Much more XSUBs are created from <CODE>Tk.xs</CODE> code.) The widget subcommands are glued to Perl basing on the list included
from <CODE>pTk/Methods.def</CODE>. In fact all the subcommands are glued to XSUBs that are related to the same 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> subroutine <CODE>XStoWidget(),</CODE> but have different data parts.



<P>

During the Perl code bootstrap the method <CODE>Tk::Widget::import</CODE> is called. This call requires all the code from particular widget packages.


<P>

Code from the widget packages calls an obscure command like


<P>

<PRE>  (bless \&quot;Text&quot;)-&gt;WidgetClass;
</PRE>

<P>

This command (actually Tk::Widget::WidgetClass()) creates three routines:
Tk::Widget::Text(), Tk::Widget::isText(), and Tk::Text::isText(). The first
one is basically <A HREF="#item_new">new</A> of <CODE>Tk::Text</CODE>, the other two return constants. It also puts the class into depository.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Inside $top = MainWindow-gtnew;

</A></STRONG><DD>
This is quite intuitive. This call goes direct to
<CODE>Tk::MainWindow::new</CODE>, that calls 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XSUB</FONT>
<CODE>Tk::MainWindow::CreateMainWindow</CODE>, that calls 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> subroutine <CODE>Tk_CreateMainWindow().</CODE> It is
a <CODE>Tk</CODE> subroutine, so here black magic ends (almost).


<P>

The only remaining black magic is that the <CODE>Tk</CODE> initialization routine creates a lot of commands, but the subroutine for
creation is usurped by <STRONG>portableTk</STRONG> and the commands are created in the package
<CODE>Tk</CODE>. They are associated to XSUBs that are related to one of three 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> subroutines <CODE>XStoSubCmd(),</CODE>
<CODE>XStoBind(),</CODE> or <CODE>XStoTk(),</CODE> but have different data
parts.


<P>

The result of the call is blessed into <CODE>Tk::MainWindow</CODE>, as it should.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Inside $top-gttitle('Text demo');

</A></STRONG><DD>
The package <CODE>Tk::Toplevel</CODE> defines a lot of subroutines on the fly on some list. All the commands from
the list are converted to the corresponding subcommands of <CODE>wm</CODE> method of the widget. Here subcommand is a command with some particular
second argument (in this case <A HREF="#item__title_">"title"</A>). Recall that the first argument is $self.


<P>

Now <CODE>Tk::Toplevel</CODE> <CODE>@ISA</CODE> <CODE>Tk::Widget</CODE>, that in turn <CODE>@ISA</CODE> <CODE>Tk</CODE>. So a call to <CODE>$top-&gt;wm('title','Text demo')</CODE> calls <CODE>Tk::wm</CODE>, that is defined during call to <CODE>Tk_CreateMainWindow().</CODE> As it is described above, the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XSUB</FONT> associated to <CODE>XStoSubCmd()</CODE> is called.



<P>

This 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> routine is defined in <CODE>tkGlue.c</CODE>. It gets the data part of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XSUB,</FONT> creates a <A HREF="#item_SV">SV</A> with the name of the command, and calls <CODE>Call_Tk()</CODE> with the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XSUB</FONT> data as the first argument, and with the name of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XSUB</FONT> stuffed into the Perl stack in the place there
 <CODE>tk</CODE> expects it. (In fact it can also reorder the arguments if it thinks it is
what you want).


<P>

The latter procedure extracts name of <CODE>tk</CODE> procedure and
<CODE>clientData</CODE> from the first argument and makes a call, using Perl stack as <CODE>argv</CODE> for the procedure. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> lot of black magic is performed afterwards to
convert result of the procedure to a Perl array return.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Inside $text = $top-gtText(background =gt $txtBg);

</A></STRONG><DD>
Above we discussed how the command <CODE>Tk::Widget::Text</CODE> is created. The above command calls it via inheritance. It is translated to 


<P>

<PRE>  Tk::Text::new($top, background =&gt; $txtBg);
</PRE>

<P>

The package <CODE>Tk::Text</CODE> has no method <A HREF="#item_new">new</A>, so the
<CODE>Tk::Widget::new</CODE> is called. In turn it calls
<CODE>Tk::Text-&gt;DoInit($top)</CODE>, that is
<CODE>Tk::Widget::DoInit(Tk::Text,$top)</CODE>, that initializes the bindings if necessary. Then it creates the name for
the widget of the form
<CODE>.text0</CODE>, and calls <CODE>Tk::text('.text0', background =&gt; $txtBg)</CODE>
(note lowercase). The result of the call is blessed into <CODE>Tk::Text</CODE>, and the method <CODE>bindtags</CODE> for this object is called. 


<P>

Now the only thing to discuss is who defines the methods <CODE>text</CODE> and
<CODE>bindtags</CODE>. The answer is that they are defined in <CODE>tkWindow.c</CODE>, and these commands are created in the package <CODE>Tk</CODE> in the same sweep that created the command <CODE>Tk::wm</CODE> discussed above.


<P>

So the the same 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> code that corresponds to the processing of corresponding 
<FONT SIZE=-1>TCL</FONT> commands is called here as well (this time via

<CODE>XStoTk</CODE> interface).


<P>

<DT><STRONG>Inside $text-gtinsert('insert','Hello, world!');

</A></STRONG><DD>
As we discussed above, the subcommands of widget procedures correspond to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XSUB</FONT> <CODE>XStoWidget</CODE>. This 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XSUB</FONT> substitutes the first argument <CODE>$text</CODE> (that is a hash reference) to an appropriate value from this hash, adds the additional argument after the first one that contains the name of the subcommand extracted from the data part of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>XSUB,</FONT> and calls the corresponding Tk 
<FONT SIZE=-1>C</FONT> subroutine via
 <CODE>Call_Tk</CODE>.
