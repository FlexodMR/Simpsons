Tcl vs perl - very old suspect documentation on porting.

This isn't really a .pod yet, nor is it Tcl vs perl it is a copy of John's
comparison of Malcolm's original perl/Tk port with the current one. It is
also out-of-date in places.

<PRE>  From: john@WPI.EDU (John Stoffel )
  
  Here are some thoughts on the new Tk extension and how I think the
  organization of the commands looks.  Mostly, I'm happy with it, it
  makes some things more organized and more consistent with tcl/tk, but
  since the overlying language is so different, I don't think we need to
  follow exactly the tcl/tk model for how to call the language.
  
  The basic structure of the Tk program is:
  
  
      require Tk;
  
      $top = MainWindow-&gt;new();
  
      #
      # create widgets
      #
  
      Tk::MainLoop;
  
      sub method1 {
      }
  
      sub methodN {
      }
  
  
  This is pretty much the same as tkperl5a5, with some cosmetic naming
  changes, and some more useful command name and usage changes.  A quick
  comparison in no particular order follows:
  
  
  tkperl5a5                             Tk
  -------------------------------       -----------------------------------
  $top=tkinit(name,display,sync);       $top=MainWindow-&gt;new();
  
  tkpack $w, ... ;              $w-&gt;pack(...)
  
  $w = Class::new($top, ...);   $w = $top-&gt;Class(...);
  
  tkmainloop;                   Tk::MainLoop;
  
  tkbind($w,&quot;&lt;key&gt;&quot;,sub);               $w-&gt;bind(&quot;&lt;key&gt;&quot;,sub);
  
  tkdelete($w, ...);            $w-&gt;delete(...);
  
  $w-&gt;scanmark(...);            $w-&gt;scan(&quot;mark&quot;, ...);
  
  $w-&gt;scandragto(...);          $w-&gt;scan(&quot;dragto&quot;, ...);
  
  $w-&gt;tkselect();                       $w-&gt;Select();
  
  $w-&gt;selectadjust(...);                $w-&gt;selection(&quot;adjust&quot;, ...);
  
  $w-&gt;selectto(...);            $w-&gt;selection(&quot;to&quot;, ...);
  
  $w-&gt;selectfrom(...);          $w-&gt;selection(&quot;from&quot;, ...);
  
  $w-&gt;tkindex(...);             $w-&gt;index(...);
  
  tclcmd(&quot;xxx&quot;,...);              &amp;Tk::xxx(...)    # all Tk commands, but no Tcl at all
  
  tclcmd(&quot;winfo&quot;, xxx, $w, ...);  $w-&gt;xxx(...);
  
                                $w-&gt;mark(...);
  
                                $w-&gt;tag(...);
  
  $w-&gt;grabstatus();             $w-&gt;grab(&quot;status&quot;);
  
  $w-&gt;grabrelease(...);         $w-&gt;grab(&quot;release&quot;, ...);
  
  focus($w);                    $w-&gt;focus;
  
  update();                     Tk-&gt;update();
  
  idletasks();                  Tk-&gt;update(&quot;idletasks&quot;);
  
  wm(&quot;cmd&quot;,$w, ...);            $w-&gt;cmd(...);
                                
  destroy($w);                  $w-&gt;destroy();
  
                                Tk::option(...);
                                  $w-&gt;OptionGet(name,Class)
  
                                $w-&gt;place(...)
  
                                Tk::property(...);
  
  
  $w = Entry::new($parent,...)
  
  is now
  
  $w = $parent-&gt;Entry(...)
  
  As this allows new to be inherited from a Window class.
  
    -method=&gt;x,-slave=&gt;y   
  
   is now
  
    -command =&gt; [x,y]
  
  1st element of list is treated as &quot;method&quot; if y is an object reference.
  (You can have -command =&gt; [a,b,c,d,e] too; b..e get passed as args).
  
  Object references are now hashes rather than scalars and there
  is only ever one such per window.  The Tcl_CmdInfo and PathName
  are entries in the hash.
  
  (This allows derived classes to 
  re-bless the hash and keep their on stuff in it too.)
  
  Tk's &quot;Tcl_Interp&quot; is in fact a ref to &quot;.&quot; window. 
  You can find all the Tk windows descended from it as their object 
  references get added (by PathName) into this hash. 
  $w-&gt;MainWindow returns this hash from any window.
  
  I think that it should extend to multiple tkinits / Tk-&gt;news  
  with different Display's - if Tk code does.
  
  Finally &quot;bind&quot; passes window as &quot;extra&quot; (or only)
  argument. Thus
  
  Tk::Button-&gt;bind(&lt;Any-Enter&gt;,&quot;Enter&quot;);
  
  Binds Enter events to Tk::Button::Enter by default
  but gets called as $w-&gt;Enter so derived class of Button can just 
  define its own Enter method. &amp;EvWref and associated globals and race
  conditions are no longer needed.
  
  
  One thing to beware of : commands bound to events with $widget-&gt;bind
  follow same pattern, but get passed extra args :
  
  $widget-&gt;bind(&lt;Any-1&gt;,[sub {print shift}, $one, $two ]);
  
  When sub gets called it has :
  
     $widget $one $two 
  
  passed.
  
  1st extra arg is reference to the per-widget hash that serves as the 
  perl object for the widget. 
  
  Every time an XEvent a reference to a special class is placed
  in the widget hash. It can be retrieved by $w-&gt;XEvent method.
  
  The methods of the XEvent class are the 
  Tcl/Tk % special characters.
  
  Thus:
  
  $widget-&gt;bind(&lt;Any-KeyPress&gt;,
                sub {
                 my $w = shift;
                 my $e = $w-&gt;XEvent;
                 print $w-&gt;PathName,&quot; &quot;,$e-&gt;A,&quot; pressed ,$e-&gt;xy,&quot;\n&quot;);
                });
  
  XEvent-&gt;xy is a special case which returns &quot;@&quot; . $e-&gt;x . &quot;,&quot; . $e-&gt;y
  which is common in Text package.
  
  Because of passing a blessed widget hash to &quot;bound&quot; subs they can be 
  bound to (possibly inherited) methods of the widget's class:
  
  Class-&gt;bind(&lt;Any-Down&gt;,Down);
  
  sub Class::Down
  {
   my $w = shift;
   # handle down arrow 
  } 
  
  
  Also:
  
  -command and friends can take a list the 1st element can be a ref to 
  as sub or a method name. Remaining elements are passed as args to the 
  sub at &quot;invoke&quot; time. Thus :
  
  $b= $w-&gt;Button(blah blah, '-command' =&gt; [sub{print shift} , $fred ]);
  
  Should do the trick, provided $fred is defined at time of button creation.
  
  Thus 1st element of list is equivalent to Malcolm's -method and second 
  would be his -slave.  Any further elements are a bonus and avoid
  having to pass ref to an array/hash as a slave.
