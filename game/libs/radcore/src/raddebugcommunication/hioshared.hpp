// Description:	This file contains the data definitions used to communicated over
//              the gamecube host i/o system. It is used to create a sockets 
//              implementation. This file is included by the host (win32 ) and 
//              targer ( GameCube ). Note that the game cube uses different endian
//              than the PC.

// Note:        It is the responsibility of the target to convert to and
//              from little endian to big endien, as the shared memory is defined
//              to use little endien.
